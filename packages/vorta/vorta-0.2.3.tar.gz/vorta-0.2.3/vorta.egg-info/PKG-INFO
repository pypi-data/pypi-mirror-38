Description: # Vorta - A Boring GUI for BorgBackup
        
        ![](https://files.qmax.us/vorta-screencast-3.gif)
        
        Vorta is an open source macOS/Linux GUI for [BorgBackup](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io). It's currently in alpha status. 
        
        ## Main features
        
        - Encrypted, deduplicated and compressed backups.
        - Works with any remote SSH account that has `borg` installed. Or try [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com) for advanced features like append-only repositories and monitoring.
        - Add SSH keys and initialize repos directly from the GUI
        - Repo keys are securely stored in macOS Keychain, Secret Service or KWallet
        - Mount existing snapshots via FUSE
        - Flexible scheduling for automatic background backups. Only allow on certain Wifis.
        - View a list of snapshots and action logs
        - Exclude options/patterns.
        
        Coming soon:
        
        - [ ] Support multiple backup profiles (in progress)
        - [ ] Repo pruning
        - [ ] Repo checking
        - [ ] Full test coverage (currently: 65%)
        - [ ] Use static type checks via mypy?
        - [ ] Packaging for Linux? How?
        
        ## Installation and Download
        ### macOS
        Download the pre-built binary from [Releases](https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/releases). Just download, unzip and run.
        
        ### Linux
        No package yet. First install Borg's own [dependencies](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies). Then install via
        ```
        $ pip install vorta
        ```
        
        After installation run with the `vorta` command.
        ```
        $ vorta
        ```
        
        ## Development
        Install in development mode:
        ```
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        Then run via
        ```
        $ vorta
        ```
        
        Qt Creator is used to edit views. Install from [their site](https://www.qt.io/download) or using Homebrew and then open the .ui files in `vorta/UI`:
        ```
        $ brew cask install qt-creator
        $ brew install qt
        ```
        
        To build a binary package:
        ```
        $ pyinstaller --clean --noconfirm vorta.spec 
        ```
        
        ### Testing (work in progress)
        Tests are in the folder `/tests`. Testing happens at the level of UI components. Calls to `borg` are mocked and can be replaced with some example json-output. To run tests:
        ```
        $ pytest
        ```
        
        To update and view coverage information
        ```
        $ coverage run -m pytest
        $ coverage report
        ```
        
        ## Privacy Policy
        - No personal data is ever stored or transmitted by this application.
        - During beta, crash reports are sent to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to quickly find bugs.
        
        ## Why the Name?
        [Vorta](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Vorta) are a race referenced in Star Trek. They serve the Dominion and are replaced by their clones if they die. Just like our backups.
