Jam.py is an event-driven framework for developing web database applications.
The Server side uses Python and werkzeug library, the client side - JavaScript,
JQuery and Bootstrap.

The don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle underlying the framework allows
a developer to focus on programming business logic and not waste time on
a routine work of programming interface and server details. That allows to
create feature rich, complex and robust applications.

Thanks for checking it out.

There is a demo project in the "demo" directory.
