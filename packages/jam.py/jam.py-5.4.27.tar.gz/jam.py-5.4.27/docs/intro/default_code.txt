============
Default code
============

The newly created project already contains some code. 

This code is located in the task client 
:doc:`module </programming/modules>`
, and catalogs client 
:doc:`module </programming/modules>`. 

The *index.html* file also have html tags for creating the application menu and 
default 
:doc:`templates of project forms </programming/interface/forms>`.

This default code is used to create the same interface as in the 
:doc:`Demo project <demo_project>` and these module are just copies of these 
Demo modules. 

The purpose of this code is to give you a quick start. These client 
modules and template definitions do not impose any restrictions. 
They can be altered or totally removed later in the development process to
create your own interface and business logic of the application.
