SQL Export
==========

Allow to export data in csv files FROM sql requests.
There are some restrictions in the sql query, you can only read datas.
No update, deletion or creation are possible.
A new menu named Export is created.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Some words are prohibited and can't be used is the query in anyways, even in
  a select query:
  - delete
  - drop
  - insert
  - alter
  - truncate
  - execute
  - create
  - update

See sql_request_abstract module to fix this issue.

* checking SQL request by execution and rollback is disabled in this module
  since variables features has been introduced. This can be fixed by
  overloading _prepare_request_check_execution() function.
