'''
Interface for boards using OpenOCD.

This interface has a special option called `openocd_options` which is just a
list of strings that are interpreted as flags to the OpenOCD class in this file.
These allow individual boards to have custom operations in a semi-reasonable
way. Note, I just made up the string (flag) names; they are not passed to
OpenOCD directly.
