Overview
========

This package implements Direction-Projection-Permutation for High Dimensional
Hypothesis Tests (DiPoPerm). For details see Wei et al, 2016 (`paper link`_, `arxiv link`_). DiProPerm "rigorously assesses whether a binary linear classifier is detecting statistically significant differences between two high-dimensional distributions."

Installation
============

The diproperm package can be installed via pip or github. This package is currently only tested in python 3.6.

::

    pip install diproperm


::

    git clone https://github.com/idc9/diproperm.git
    python setup.py install

Example
=======

.. code:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # %matplotlib inline

    from diproperm.DiProPerm import DiProPerm

    # toy binary class dataset (two isotropic Gaussians)
    X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100, n_features=2, centers=2, cluster_std=2)

    # DiProPerm with mean difference classifier, mean difference summary
    # statistic, and 1000 permutation samples.
    dpp = DiProPerm(B=1000, stat='md', clf='md')
    dpp.fit(X, y)

    dpp.test_stats_['md']
