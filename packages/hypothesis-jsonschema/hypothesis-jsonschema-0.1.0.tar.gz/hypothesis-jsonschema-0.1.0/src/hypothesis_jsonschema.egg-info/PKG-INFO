Description: # hypothesis-jsonschema
        
        A [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io) strategy for generating data
        that matches some [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).
        It is currently in early alpha, but you can use it if you want.
        
        The public API consists of a just two functions:
        
        1. `hypothesis_jsonschema.from_schema` takes a JSON schema and returns a
           Hypothesis strategy which generates objects that match the schema.
        2. `hypothesis_jsonschema.json_schemata` returns a Hypothesis strategy
           which generates arbitrary JSON schemata.
        
        `hypothesis-jsonschema` does not support Python 2, because
        [it's close to end of life](https://pythonclock.org/) and Python 3.6+ is a
        much nicer language.  Contact me if you would like this changed and are
        willing to either pay for or do the work to support Python 2.
