Description: root-solver provides solvers for polynomials of orders 2 and 3 (with plans for 4
        and possibly higher), using the algorithms of Kahan and others. See
        http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math128/Cubic.pdf for more information about
        the algorithms included.
        
        Additionally root-solver includes support for tracking a single root as the
        coefficients of the polynomial changes.
