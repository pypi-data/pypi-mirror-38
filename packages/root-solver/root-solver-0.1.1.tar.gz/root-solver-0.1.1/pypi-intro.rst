root-solver provides solvers for polynomials of orders 2 and 3 (with plans for 4
and possibly higher), using the algorithms of Kahan and others. See
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Math128/Cubic.pdf for more information about
the algorithms included.

Additionally root-solver includes support for tracking a single root as the
coefficients of the polynomial changes.
