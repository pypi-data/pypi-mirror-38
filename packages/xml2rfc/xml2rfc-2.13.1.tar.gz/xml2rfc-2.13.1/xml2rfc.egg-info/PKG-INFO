Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the DTD given in RFC2629_ (or it's `inofficial successor`_).
        
        The current incarnation of **xml2rfc** provides output in the following
        formats: Paginated and unpaginated ascii text, html, nroff, and expanded xml.
        Only the paginated text format is currently (January 2013) accepable as draft
        submissions to the IETF.

        Installation
        ============
        
        System Install
        --------------
        
        To install a system-wide version of xml2rfc, download and unpack the `xml2rfc 
        distribution package`_, then cd into the resulting package directory and run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Alternatively, if you have the 'pip_' command ('Pip Installs Packages') installed,
        you can run pip to download and install the package::
        
            $ pip install xml2rfc
        
        .. _lxml:				http://lxml.de/
        .. _pip:				https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _xml2rfc distribution package:	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _requests:				http://docs.python-requests.org/
        
        
        User Install
        ------------
        
        If you want to perform a local installation for a specific user,
        you have a couple of options.  You may use python's default location
        of user site-packages by specifying the flag ``--user``.  These locations are:
        
            * UNIX: $HOME/.local/lib/python<ver>/site-packages
            * OSX: $HOME/Library/Python/<ver>/lib/python/site-packages
            * Windows: %APPDATA%/Python/Python<ver>/site-packages
        
        You can additionally combine the flag ``--install-scripts`` with ``--user`` to
        specify a directory on your PATH to install the xml2rfc executable to.  For
        example, the following command::
        
            $ python setup.py install --user --install-scripts=$HOME/bin
        
        will install the xml2rfc library and data to your local site-packages
        directory, and an executable python script ``xml2rfc`` to $HOME/bin.
        
        Custom Install
        --------------
        
        The option ``--prefix`` allows you to specify the base path for all
        installation files.  The setup.py script will exit with an error if your
        PYTHONPATH is not correctly configured to contain the library path
        the script tries to install to.
        
        The command is used as follows::
        
            $ python setup.py install --prefix=<path>
        
        For further fine-tuning of the installation behavior, you can get a list
        of all available options by running::
        
            $ python setup.py install --help
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        **Options**

        =========
        
        
        Version 2.13.1 (17 Nov 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Filled in missing rendering values for the case when cref is being 
            rendered in inline context in the v3 text renderer.  Fixes issue #380.
        
          * Under python 3.6, dictionary keys() return a set-like object that 
            cannot be indexed.  Convert to list for our purposes.  Fixes issue #379
        
          * Remove the 'alt' attribute on <artwork> with SVG after setting <desc>.
        
          * Fixed an issue with missing svg namespace when inserting <desc>.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.13.0 (17 Nov 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release provides an number of improvements.  Rendering of all v3
          elements should now be in place for the v3 text and html formatters, and
          the renderers have been updated to follow the issue resolutions so far.
          A bug in the generation of boilerplate for BCPs has been fixed.  Feedback
          on unexpected postal address data has been improved, as has feedback on
          unexpected combinations of stream, category, and consensus settings.
        
          Details from the commit log:
        
          * In the html formatter:
        
            - Added indentation support for <dl> to the v3 html renderer.  
        
            - Fixed a bug in the display of author names in the author addresses
              section when no postal information is given.  
        
            - Improved <eref> rendering for the case when no eref text is provided.  
        
            - Corrected the anchor placement for slugified names of figures and
              tables.  
        
            - Added support for <referencegroup>.  
        
            - Added a missing CSS class for <seriesInfo> rendering.  
        
            - Added support for right and center alignment of tables.
        
          * In the text formatter:
        
            - Added v3 text formatter support for rendering of blockquote and cref.  
        
            - Minor other tweaks.
        
          * In the preptool: 
        
            - Added support for <referencegroup> elements.  
        
            - Added support for the <rfc> version attribute.  
        
            - Fixed a string formatting bug.  
        
            - Added attribute valididty checking for integer-valued attributes.  
        
            - Removed the forced inclusion of day for RFC publication dates, reverting
              to permitting publication with only year and month.
        
            - Added more sophisticated checking and setting of consensus, based on
              what is valid for the given stream and category.  
        
            - Refined the handling when given input that already contains boilerplate,
              authors addresses and index.
        
          * In the v2v3 converter:
        
            - Added setting of the <rfc> version attribute.
        
            - Removed dubious elimination of <format> elements pointing to alternative
              reference URLs.
        
            - Fixed a couple of instances of buggy error reporting.
        
          * Changed util.postal.get_normalized_address() to return a filled-in adr 
            structure even if no country could be identified, for more consistent code 
            in other places.
        
          * In the Relax NG schema files:
        
            - Changed the v3 schema default value for <dl> newline so that the effect 
              is the same as for the old 'hanging' default value.
        
            - Added a 'derivedAnchor' attribute for <referencegroup>, matching that of
              <reference>.
        
          * In the CSS style sheet:
        
            - Changed the CSS class for Reference Section definition lists from
              'reference' to 'references'.  
        
            - Added styling for table alignment and
              applied the same styling for table labels as for figure labels.
        
          * Added bcp14, em, iref, strong, sub, and sup to the permitted elements 
            in <name>.
        
          * Fixed some issues with the error messages for combinations of stream, 
            category, and consensus.
        
          * Added code to honour the "display" attribute of <cref>.
        
          * Added a preptool action to check the <rfc> attributes submissionType 
            (i.e., stream), category, and consensus for validity.  Invalid combinations 
            are called out, and warnings are issued about setting missing settings to 
            default values.
        
          * With v2 formatters, treat consensus for BCPs the same way as STD 
            documents, 
        
          * Refactored some logging and address functionality, improved address
            warnings and other address-related tweaks.
