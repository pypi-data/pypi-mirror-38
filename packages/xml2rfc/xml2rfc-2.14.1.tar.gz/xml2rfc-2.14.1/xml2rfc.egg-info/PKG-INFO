Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the DTD given in RFC2629_ (or it's `inofficial successor`_).
        
        The current incarnation of **xml2rfc** provides output in the following
        formats: Paginated and unpaginated ascii text, html, nroff, and expanded xml.
        Only the paginated text format is currently (January 2013) accepable as draft
        submissions to the IETF.

        Installation
        ============
        
        System Install
        --------------
        
        To install a system-wide version of xml2rfc, download and unpack the `xml2rfc 
        distribution package`_, then cd into the resulting package directory and run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Alternatively, if you have the 'pip_' command ('Pip Installs Packages') installed,
        you can run pip to download and install the package::
        
            $ pip install xml2rfc
        
        .. _lxml:				http://lxml.de/
        .. _pip:				https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _xml2rfc distribution package:	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _requests:				http://docs.python-requests.org/
        
        
        User Install
        ------------
        
        If you want to perform a local installation for a specific user,
        you have a couple of options.  You may use python's default location
        of user site-packages by specifying the flag ``--user``.  These locations are:
        
            * UNIX: $HOME/.local/lib/python<ver>/site-packages
            * OSX: $HOME/Library/Python/<ver>/lib/python/site-packages
            * Windows: %APPDATA%/Python/Python<ver>/site-packages
        
        You can additionally combine the flag ``--install-scripts`` with ``--user`` to
        specify a directory on your PATH to install the xml2rfc executable to.  For
        example, the following command::
        
            $ python setup.py install --user --install-scripts=$HOME/bin
        
        will install the xml2rfc library and data to your local site-packages
        directory, and an executable python script ``xml2rfc`` to $HOME/bin.
        
        Custom Install
        --------------
        
        The option ``--prefix`` allows you to specify the base path for all
        installation files.  The setup.py script will exit with an error if your
        PYTHONPATH is not correctly configured to contain the library path
        the script tries to install to.
        
        The command is used as follows::
        
            $ python setup.py install --prefix=<path>
        
        For further fine-tuning of the installation behavior, you can get a list
        of all available options by running::
        
            $ python setup.py install --help
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        **Options**
            The following parameters affect how xml2rfc behaves, however none are required.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.14.1 (23 Nov 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * The v3 attribute xml:base of <reference> is not compatible with the v2
            DTD.  Added xml:base to the DTD for <reference> in order to be able to
            work from the same reference cache for v2 and v3, without backing out
            the issue #381 resolution.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.14.0 (23 Nov 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added missing '(if approved)' annotations for obsoleted and updated lines
            in v3 html rendering of drafts.
        
          * Fixed the case of appendix section numbers in v3 html output.
        
          * Removed rfc2629 dtd validation for input files with <rfc version="3"> set.
        
          * Tweaked the lxml resolver callback to not accept xi:include names lacking
            an '.xml' extension under v3.  Added setting of xml:base before caching
            xi:include content, in order to not loose the origin.  Fixes issue #381.
        
          * Sorted the entries in requirements.txt lexicographically.
        
          * Added a check for duplicate id attribute values after each include of svg
            content into generated html, as duplicates may cause display problems with
            some browsers.
        
          * Added back the ability to place <iref> elements in a location where they 
            will translate to invalid HTML.  Avoided invalid HTML by pushing the span 
            up one level, as a previous sibling, when needed.  Fixes issue #378.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.13.1 (17 Nov 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Filled in missing rendering values for the case when cref is being 
            rendered in inline context in the v3 text renderer.  Fixes issue #380.
        
          * Under python 3.6, dictionary keys() return a set-like object that 
            cannot be indexed.  Convert to list for our purposes.  Fixes issue #379
        
          * Remove the 'alt' attribute on <artwork> with SVG after setting <desc>.
        
          * Fixed an issue with missing svg namespace when inserting <desc>.
