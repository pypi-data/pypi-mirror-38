Description: Chanterelle
        ===========
        Chanterelle is a command line utility written in Python 3 that synchronizes
        the contents of an S3 bucket with a local static website. This tool has no
        dependency on Jekyll or Ruby, but assumes a default configuration that works
        with the default structure of a Jekyll site.
        
        Chanterelle was designed to reduce the monetary cost of using the S3 API by
        only making changes that are necessary to a bucket. Files are not uploaded if
        already present in the bucket with the same content, and bulk list and delete
        operations are used.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To install with Chanterelle you will need `Python 3 <https://www.python.org>`_
        and `setuptools <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/
        #requirements-for-installing-packages>`_. Run the following to install the
        latest release of Chanterelle directly from PyPI:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install chanterelle
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        Chanterelle can be configured using a YAML file placed in the project root
        called :code:`_upload.yml`. Jekyll's :code:`_config.yml` is not read by
        Chanterelle. The following is a table of keys for the configuration file:
        
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | Key        | Description                                                    |
        +============+================================================================+
        | bucket     | Name of the S3 bucket to synchronize. This key is required.    |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | profile    | Name of the `AWS profile <http://docs.aws.amazon.com           |
        |            | /cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html>`_ to use.    |
        |            | The default profile will be used if omitted.                   |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | site_root  | Path to the root of the generated site. Default value is       |
        |            | :code:`_site`.                                                 |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | mime_types | Map of file extension (including dot) to mime-type that will   |
        |            | be in addition to the system's map to determine the            |
        |            | Content-Type of a file.                                        |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | charset    | Content-Type charset assigned to files that are subtypes of    |
        |            | the :code:`text` type (:code:`text/*`). Default value is       |
        |            | :code:`utf-8`.                                                 |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | strip_html | If set to :code:`true` the :code:`.html` extension will be     |
        |            | stripped from the filenames of uploaded files. This is useful  |
        |            | for permalink styles that dont include an extension. Default   |
        |            | value is :code:`false`.                                        |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        | delete_old | If set to :code:`true` files in the bucket that do not exist   |
        |            | in the local directory will be deleted. Default value is       |
        |            | :code:`false`.                                                 |
        +------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
        
        AWS Credentials
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        In addition to :code:`_upload.yml` you will also need to configure AWS
        credentials. These are ommited from :code:`_upload.yml` so it can be checked
        into version control without sharing keys with contributors.
        
        There are several ways to `manually configure <http://boto.cloudhackers.com
        /en/latest/boto_config_tut.html#credentials>`_ the credentials that Chanterelle
        uses, but the easiest way for those only using a single set of credentials is
        to use the `configure command <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/>`_ of
        the `aws command line tool <http://docs.aws.amazon.com
        /cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ aws configure
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        Once you have created :code:`_upload.yml` and set AWS credentials, you can run
        Chanterelle from the command line:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ chanterelle
