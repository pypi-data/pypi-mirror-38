Description: # OpenAPI-extension-remover
        A tool to remove extensions of an OpenAPI document so that the resulting file conformes to the specification and can be used by other OpenAPI tools.
        
        ## Why did I create this tool?
        One day I wanted to generate HTML from my OpenAPI document but I couldn't because the tool that I was using doesn't support vendor extensions (which is a part of the OpenAPI documentation). As such, to make the process more expedite I made this simple tool.
        
        ## Future work
        In the future, if the need arises I plan to evolve this tool to become an OpenAPI command line utility.
        
        ## Notes
        This project welcomes any improvement by pull request.
        
        # How to install?
        Execute `sudo pip3 install removeOasExtension` on a terminal to system-wide install the tool. Exclude the pip version
         if you only have one version of Python installed and don't need to differentiate it.
        
        # Usage
        Basic usages:
        
        **Read from stdin and output to stdout**: removeOasExtension < cat sample.json
