"""Compare two dose grids with the gamma index.

This module is a python implementation of the gamma index.
It computes 1, 2, or 3 dimensional gamma with arbitrary gird sizes while
interpolating on the fly.
This module makes use of some of the ideas presented within
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.2721657>.
