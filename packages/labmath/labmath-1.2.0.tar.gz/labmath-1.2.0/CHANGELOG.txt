Version 1.2.0:

Various improvements to various docstrings.

New function: polyval
New function: cbrtmod_prime
New function: polyroots_prime
New function: hensel
New function: polyrootsmod
New function: polyaddmodp
New function: polysubmodp
New function: polymulmodp
New function: polydivmodmodp
New function: gcmd
New function: polypowmodpmodpoly
New function: frobenius_prp

Deleted function: hensel_lift
Deleted function: hensel_lift_2
Deleted function: sqrtmod_primepow
This technically breaks backwards compatibility, suggesting that the new version number should be 2.0.0, but those were helper functions for sqrtmod and not intended to be called by the user, so I'm only incrementing the version to 1.2.0.

Bugfix: Docstrings claim that sqrtmod's output would be sorted.  It wasn't always so.  It is now.

Version 1.1.0:

New data: labmathversion

New function: liouville
New function: egypt_short
New function: egypt_greedy
New function: randomfactored
New function: secm
New function: ecmparams

Altered behavior: randprime's output is now uniformly sampled among all primes of the indicated size, and the primality test used is user-selectable.  Full backwards compatibility is preserved.
Altered behavior: ecm is now a shell function that calls secm repeatedly (which is where the factoring now happens) using parameters pulled from ecmparams.  Backwards compatibility is preserved in the positional arguments; backwards compatibility is broken for the keyword arguments.

Version 1.0.8:

Improved credits and a few docstrings.
Fixed a bug in which product was not imported from itertools.

Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.7: fumbling around with PyPI.
