Description: ====
        Fir1
        ====
        
        An efficient finite impulse response (FIR) filter class
        written in C++ with python wrapper.
        
        The class offers also adaptive filtering
        using the least mean square (LMS) or normalised least mean
        square (NLMS) algorithm.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Linux
        -----
        
        If you want to install it via pip you first need
        to install the fir1 filter package::
        
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:berndporr/usbdux
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt install fir1
            sudo apt install fir1-dev
        
        Then install the python package with pip::
            pip3 install fir1
        
        Note that this will install from source so you need
        to have swig installed.
        
        You can also install from source::
        
            git clone https://github.com/berndporr/fir1
            cd fir1
            cmake .
            make
            make install
            python3 setup.py install
        
        
        Windows
        -------
        The setup.py is alpha and needs to be tested.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Realtime filtering
        ------------------
        
        The filter is a realtime filter which always receives the
        values one by one so can process data as it comes in from
        an ADC converter. This is simulated here with the for loop::
        
            import fir1
            b = signal.firwin(999,0.1)
            f = fir1.Fir1(b)
            for i in range(len(noisy_signal)):
                clean_signal[i] = f.filter(noisy_signal[i])
        
        The constructor ``Fir1(b)`` receives the coefficients and
        then filtering is performed with the method ``filter()``.
        
        
        LMS adaptive filter

        Please check the C++ code for examples and the main
        github page. The functions are identical.
