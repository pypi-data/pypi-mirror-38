Description: `find_ida_user_dir` determines the current user's IDA Pro user directory in a platform independent way.
        
        To use 
        
        ```python
        import find_ida_user_dir
        user_dir = find_ida_user_dir.find_path()
        
        plugins_dir = find_ida_user_dir.find_path("plugins")
        ```
        
        `find_ida_user_dir` first checks for the existence of an `IDAUSR` environment variable: if it is present, that is returned. If not, the correct path of the default user directory as described in the [IDA Pro documentation](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1375.shtml) is returned. If a subdirectory name is given then the path to that subdirectory in the IDA user directory is returned.
        
        If the `find_ida_user_dir.find_path` function is called from inside IDA Python then it delegates the job of finding the correct path to the `ida_diskio.get_user_idadir` function.
        
        `find_ida_user_dir` is useful for creating installation scripts for IDA plugins which need to identify the IDA user directory so that they know where to copy the plugin module to.
        
        This module also installs a console script called `find_ida_user_dir`: it can be run from a command line and prints the path returned by `find_path`.
