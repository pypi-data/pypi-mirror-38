        Next release
        ------------
        
        - Replace virtualenv with tox as a testing extra.
        
        - Remove support for Python 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3, and add support for Python 3.5.
          See https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/pull/264
        
        - Omit the ``Upload`` tab for folders which can not contain files. See
          https://github.com/Pylons/substanced/pull/247.
        
        - Added Finnish translation.
        
        - Fixed bug in scaffold that prevented Document properties tab from showing up
          in the SDI.
        
        - ``substanced.file.FileUploadPropertySheet`` (which backs the File->Upload
          property tab) did not properly clear tempfiles from the upload tmpdir.
        
        - ``substanced.file.views.AddFileView`` (which backs the Add -> File form in
          the SDI) did not properly clear tempfiles from the upload tmpdir.
        
        - Changing a NameSchemaNode property via a propertysheet view (ie.
          changing the name of an item in a folder via its propertysheet)
          would fail with an exception if the name you chose was already
          used within the folder.  It now shows a flash message and prevents
          the change.
        
        - Removed Python 2.6 compatibility shim ``substanced._compat.total_ordering``.
          
        1.0 (2018-11-06)
        ================
