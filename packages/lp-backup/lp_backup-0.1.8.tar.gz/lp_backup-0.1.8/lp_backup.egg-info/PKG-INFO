        Easily backup data from lastpass to your own storage.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You first need to install the [lastpass commandline
        tool](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) for your platform.
        It is used internally for accessing the lastpass api.
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install lp_backup
        ```
        
        Install [fs.webdavfs](https://github.com/damndam/webdavfs) for webdav support.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        from lp_backup import Runner
        
        # create backup runner
        example_backup_runner = Runner("/home/YOUR_USER/.config/lp_backup.yml")
        # run backup
        backup_file_name = example_backup_runner.backup()
        print(backup_file_name)
        
        # restore backup to /tmp/example-full-restore.csv (which is PLAIN TEXT, be sure to delete after use)
        backup_file_name.restore(backup_file_name, "/tmp/test-full-restore.csv")
        
        ```
