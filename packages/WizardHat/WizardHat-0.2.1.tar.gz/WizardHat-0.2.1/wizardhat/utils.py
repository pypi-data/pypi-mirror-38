"""Utilities for use within the WizardHat API and its extensions.

The intention of this module is to avoid unnecessary repetition of programming
constructs. This includes routine manipulations of strings or data structures
(but not calculations/transformations on data itself), interfacing with the
operating system, or general-purpose method decorators.

    Callbacks may be registered with an `EventHook` instance using the
    incremental add operator (`event_hook_instance += some_callback_function`),
    and deregistered by incremental subtraction. When the instance's `fire`
    method is called (i.e. upon some event), all of the registered callback
    functions will also be called.

    The primary use for this class is in `Buffer` classes, whose `EventHook`
    instances allow them to call the update functions of all downstream objects
    (e.g. `Plotter` or `Transformer` instances).
