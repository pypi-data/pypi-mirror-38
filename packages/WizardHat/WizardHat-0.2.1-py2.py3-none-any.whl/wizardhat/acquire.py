"""Acquisition of data from streaming protocols, particularly LSL.

The `Lab Streaming Layer`_ (LSL) is a protocol for transmission of time series
measurements over local networks. A number of tools are available for handling
data streamed over LSL; please refer to its documentation for details.

Note:
    In the standard implementation of Python (CPython), thread execution is
    managed by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Because of this, and in
    particular because of unavoidable background processes such as memory
    management/garbage collection, Python programs cannot guarantee real-time
    execution, but only approach it. Thus, at high process loads there may be
    momentary streaming lags.

TODO:
    * dejitter_timestamps may be irrelevant depending on ble2lsl operation
    * auto-acquire device if none given?
