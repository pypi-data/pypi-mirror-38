Upon opening a file, :class:`~bapsflib.lapd.File` calls on the
:class:`~bapsflib._hdf.maps.hdfmap.HDFMap` class to construct a
mapping of the HDF5 file's internal data structure, see section
:ref:`file_mappings` for details on the mapping construction.  Since the
various elements in the HDF5 data structure defined by the LaPD DAQ
system can evolve over time, the purpose of the mapping construction is
to provide a translation of the evolving data structure into a universal
format that will be consistent over time for both the user and the
:mod:`bapsflib` methods. An instance of the mapping object is bound to
:class:`~bapsflib.lapd.File` as
:attr:`~bapsflib.lapd.File.file_map`

.. code-block:: python3

    >>> f = lapd.File('test.hdf5')
    >>> f.file_map
    <bapsflib._hdf.maps.hdfmap.HDFMap>

This mapping object is used by :mod:`bapsflib`'s high-level functions
to collect data requested by the user.  The user can also delve into the
mapping object to learn about the setup and configurations for the
various devices (digitizers, control devices, MSI diagnostics, etc.)
used in the experimental run. [*]_

The opened file object (``f``) provides a set of high-level methods and
attributes for th user to interface with, see :numref:`f_meth_table`.
