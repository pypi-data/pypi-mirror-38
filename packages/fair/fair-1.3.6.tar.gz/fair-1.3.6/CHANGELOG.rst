(`#52 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/52>`) Fixed bug that didn't pick up first year of CO2 concentrations and radiative forcing after restart_in. Changed internal book-keeping of CO2 concentrations to be absolute, rather than anomaly from pre-industrial, to be consistent with other GHGs.

(`#49 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/issues/49>`) Change name of model to FaIR in docs, README and example notebooks

(`#47 <https://github.com/OMS-NetZero/FAIR/pull/47>`_) Remove ``requirements.txt`` and add ``.readthedocs.yml`` to put install requirements all in one place
