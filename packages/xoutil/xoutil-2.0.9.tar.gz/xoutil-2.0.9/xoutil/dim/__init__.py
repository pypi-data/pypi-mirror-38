'''Facilities to work with `concrete numbers`_.

The name `dim`:mod: is a short of dimension.  We borrow it from the topic
"dimensional analysis", even though the scope of this module is less
ambitious.

This module is divided in two major parts:

- `xoutil.dim.meta`:mod: which allows to define almost any kind of quantity
  decorated with a unit.

- Other modules ``xoutil.dim.*`` which contains applications of the
  definitions in `~xoutil.dim.meta`:mod:.  In particular,
  `xoutil.dim.base`:mod: contains the `base quantities`_ for the
  `International System of Quantities`_.
