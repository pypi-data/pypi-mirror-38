'''Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility.

The name comes from (Manu's idea') "2 raised to the power of 3".

There is an existing library written by "Benjamin Peterson" named six_, both
(`xoutil.eight` and `six`) can be used together since this module don't claim
to be a replacement of six_, just some extra extensions.  Nevertheless, there
are some simple definitions that even when are in six_ also are defined here.

This package also fixes some issues from PyPy interpreter.

.. _six: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six
