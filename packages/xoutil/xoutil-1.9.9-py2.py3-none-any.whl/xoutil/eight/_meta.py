'''Private module for all mix-ins definitions.

This module is private because is used for two client modules for the `mixin`
concept.  See `Mixin`:class: for more information.

                        print_function as _py3_print,

    '''Base-class to several mix-in kinds.

    - Syntax unification for meta-classes between Python 2 and 3.  See
      `xoutil.eight.meta.metaclass`:func: for more information.  For example::

        >>> from xoutil.eight.abc import ABCMeta
        >>> from xoutil.eight.meta import metaclass
        >>> class Foobar(metaclass(ABCMeta)):
        ...     pass
        >>> (Foobar.__bases__ == (object, ), type(Foobar) is ABCMeta)
        (True, True)

    - Helper base classes that when used as a base force a meta-class but
      nothing else (the new class don't have helper-class in its bases).  See
      `xoutil.eight.mixins.helper_class`:func: for more information.  A good
      example is our example of `xoutil.eight.abc.ABC`, if used as a base,
      `ABCMeta` is imposed::

        >>> from xoutil.eight.abc import ABC, ABCMeta
        >>> class Foobar(ABC):
        ...     pass
        >>> (Foobar.__bases__ == (object, ), type(Foobar) is ABCMeta)
        (True, True)

    - Class templates that can be used later to weave main classes composed
      for those mix-ins.  For example::

        >>> from xoutil.eight.abc import ABCMeta
        >>> from xoutil.eight.mixins import mixin
        >>> class Foo(object):
        ...     pass
        >>> class Bar(dict):
        ...     pass
        >>> class EggMeta(type):
        ...     pass
        >>> Test = mixin(Foo, Bar, meta=(EggMeta, ABCMeta), name='Test')

    - Weaver a main-class using several parts.  For example::

        >>> class Foobar(list, mixin(Test)):
        ...     pass
