'''Extensions to Python's ``io`` module.

You may use it as drop-in replacement of ``io``.  Although we don't document
all items here.  Refer to `io`:mod: documentation.

In Python 2, buil-int `open`:func: is different from `io.open`:func:; in
Python 3 are the same function.

So, generated files with the built-in funtion in Python 2, can not be
processed using *abc* types, for example::

  f = open('test.rst')
  assert isinstance(f, io.IOBase)

will fail in Python 2 and not in Python 3.

Another incompatibilities:

- `file` type doesn't exists in Python 3.

- Python 2 instances created with `io.StringIO`:class`, or with
  `io.open`:func: using text mode, don't accept `str` values, so it will be
  better to use any of the standards classes (`StringIO.StringIO`:class:,
  `cStringIO.StringIO`:class: or `open`:func: built-in).
