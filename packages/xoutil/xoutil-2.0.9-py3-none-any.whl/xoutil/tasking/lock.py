'''Synchronization lock tools.

A lock object is a synchronization primitive.  Locks are used as Python
Context Managers with only one method (`enter`) and one property (`locked`).

The method `enter` is used with the Python ``with`` statement and the property
`locked` is logically True or False depending if the lock is active or not.

For example::

  >>> from xoutil.lock import context_lock as ctx

  >>> def get_lock_value():
  ...     return 'Yes' if ctx.locked else 'No'

  >>> with ctx.enter():
  ...     one = get_lock_value()
  >>> two = get_lock_value()
  >>> (one, two)
  ('Yes', 'No')


Locks are implemented using module-property; this means that each time you
import it, a different lock is returned::

  >>> from xoutil.tasking.lock import context_lock as one
  >>> from xoutil.tasking.lock import context_lock as two
  >>> one is two
  False

The function `context_lock`:func: implement a module property to create a
class that use an execution context, see `xoutil.context`:mod: module for more
information.

If other lock mechanisms are going to be implementing, for example using
threading, this is the place.
