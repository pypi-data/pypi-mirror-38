Welcome to PScript's documentation!
===================================

PScript is a Python to JavaScript compiler, and is also the name of the subset
of Python that this compiler supports. It was developed as a part of
`Flexx <http://flexx.live>`_ (as ``flexx.pyscript``) and is now represented
by its own project. Although it is still an important part of Flexx, it can
also be useful by itself.
