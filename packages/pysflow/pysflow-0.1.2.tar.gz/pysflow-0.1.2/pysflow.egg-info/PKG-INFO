Description: pysflow
        =======
        A simple sFlow parser library for Python.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        This project is built and tested against Python 3.6 and 3.7. Older versions
        might or might not work. Tests for this are planned to be included in later
        releases. The library has no external dependencies and only uses the built-in
        ``xdrlib`` and ``ipaddress`` functions.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        To install the library, run::
        
            pip install pysflow
        
        or if you have cloned this Git repository, run::
        
           python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        A very simple program that uses the library can be found in ``example.py``.
        There is one high-level entry point, ``sflow.decode()``, which takes a byte
        array as the argument. It will decode a raw sFlow datagram into a Python dict.
        Each component (flow record, data type, etc.) can be used in a stand-alone way
        by calling the static ``.decode()`` function on the class. This function takes
        an ``xdrlib.Unpacker`` as an argument.
