Description: lint-along
        ===============
        
        Lint and commit with an adjusted linting song as message.
        
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        I always make some stupid mistakes against the style guide, and because I never bothered to fix my half-baked linter
        setup for VIM and I apparently feel too smart for githooks, I always end up linting my code after I made it into a PR.
        
        So instead of giving those commits a bland message I opted for some music inspired titles, and lint-along was born.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install lint-along
        
        From source:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Execute `lint-along` in a git enabled directory.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            lint-along
        
        
        Playlist
        --------
        
        The hits that make bland linting commits :sparkles:
        
        `Spotify <https://open.spotify.com/user/tobi.beernaert/playlist/7e3T6T18e4JVl01Vasgf3m?si=qvLwEknoQqSD5kMabwxoEA>`_
        
        Todo
        ====
        
        - Pass the linter command via [yet another] config file.
        - Some documentation would be nice
        - Some tests would also be nice
        - Add more songs
        
        
        
        
        disclaimer: probably really buggy, so use with cautious.
