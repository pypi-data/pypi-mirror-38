        Baldrick: A cunning plan for GitHub bots
        ----------------------------------------
        
        This is a (GitHub) bot framework which is designed to have a pluggable and
        configurable setup for responding to webhooks.
        
        Baldrick grew out of `astropy-bot <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-bot>`__
        but refactored to be generic and easy to configure.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Baldrick is designed to be imported and used to construct a Flask app. An
        example repository which could be deployed on
        `Dokku <http://dokku.viewdocs.io/>`__ or `Heroku <https://www.heroku.com/>`__
        can be found in the ``template`` directory.
