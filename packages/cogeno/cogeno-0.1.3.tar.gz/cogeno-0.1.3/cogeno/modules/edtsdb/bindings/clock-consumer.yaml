        List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair for each clock
        input to the device. Note - if the clock provider specifies '0' for
        clock-cells, then only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

        List of clock input name strings sorted in the same order as the clocks

        Empty property indicating that child nodes can inherit named clocks from
        this node. Useful for bus nodes to provide a clock to their children.
