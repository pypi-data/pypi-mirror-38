        **Creating Auth Client**
        
        Implement AuthClient with following two methods
        
        ```
        class AuthClient:
        
            def fetch_auth_token(self):
                #Logic to generate auth token
                return ""
        
        
            def get_auth_header(self):
                return {
                    "${HEADER_NAME}": self.fetch_auth_token()
                }
        
        ```
        
        
        **Creating Feed Client**
        
        
        ```
        
        feed_url = "https://feed.com/type/events"
        auth_client = AuthClient()
        feed_client = FeedClient(feed_url, auth_client)
        
        ```
        
        
        
        ** Reading Events **
        
        To read events,
        
        ```
          feed_client.fetch(url, headers, params)
        ```
        
        All fields url, headers and params are optional.
        
        
        
        ** Get an Event **
        
        To read one particular event,
        
        ```
          feed_client.fetch_event(event_id, url, headers)
        ```
        
        url and headers are optional
        
        
        
        ** Publish an Event **
        
        To publish an event,
        
        ```
          feed_client.create_entry(entry, url, headers)
        ```
        
        
        url and headers are optional
        
        
         To create an entry json to publish, there are entry, content, event classes defined and
         also method to transform the object to json as feed requires
        
        
        ** Work In Progress **
        
        We are currently working on setting up Redis, so that we can queue the events and publish the events by reading the queue
