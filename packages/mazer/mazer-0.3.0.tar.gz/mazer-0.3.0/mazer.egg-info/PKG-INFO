        =====
        
        Ansible content manager
        
        A new command-line tool for managing `Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__ content.
        
        Expect breaking changes!
        ------------------------
        
        Mazer is experimental, and currently only available for tech-preview. Use with lots of caution! It is not intended for use in
        production environments, nor is it currently intended to replace the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool.
        
        If you're installing Ansible content in a production environment, or need assistance with Ansible, please visit the `Ansible Project <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__,
        or the `Ansible docs site <https://docs.ansible.com>`__.

        Origin of "Mazer"
        -----------------
        
        The name Mazer comes from a character from Ender's Game, Mazer Rackham, that Wikipedia describes as "the half-Māori captain who singlehandedly stopped the Second Invasion by realizing that the Buggers are a hive mind. Due to his inability to pass on his knowledge, he was forced to spend fifty years at relativistic speeds (eight years to Rackham) so that he could train the next commander — Ender Wiggin."
        
        A mazer is also a hardwood drinking vessel.
