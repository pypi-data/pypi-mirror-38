Description: sshdocker
        =========
        
        A small convenience command to interactively deal with containers running remotely.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install ssh-docker``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ::
        
            ssh-docker <hostname>
        
        This will open up an interactive shell (similar to how Supervisord works) allowing you to directly query / perform actions on the containers on the host.
        
        If you'd like to enable autocomplete in ZSH, you can add the following to your ``~/.zshrc`` file:
        
        ::
        
            eval "$(_SSH_DOCKER_COMPLETE=source_zsh ssh-docker)"
        
        By entering ``ssh-docker [TAB]`` you will be able to cycle through all hostnames in your SSH config file.
