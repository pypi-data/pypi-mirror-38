__**Warning**__: Currently Linux/BSD/Mac only, it may be a while before support for Windows comes back

**Note**: You can find a feature list, current bugs, and things I'm currently working
on on my [webpage](http://natosaka.host/dline.html).

## How to install
-------------------------

### Option A: pip (through PyPi)

1. Run  
    `pip3 install --user --process-dependency-link dline`

### Option B: pip (local repository)

1. Clone repo  
    `git clone https://github.com/NatTupper/dline`
2. Run  
    `pip3 install --user --process-dependency-link .`

### Option C: Running from the repo folder

1. Clone the repo  
    `git clone https://github.com/NatTupper/dline`
2. Install the dependencies:  
    `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`


## How to use
--------------------------
1. Find your discord "token"
    * Go to http://discordapp.com/channels/@me
    * Open your browser's developer console. (Normally `F12` or `CTRL-SHIFT-I`)
    * Go into "network" and hit F5. Type "v6" in the filter field
    * Filter by XHR and look through entries until you find "authorization" under
      "request headers". This is your token.
    If all else fails, join the dev discord and we'll be glad to help!
2. Run `dline --store-token` to store your token
3. Run `dline --copy-skeleton` to get a template config
4. Edit `~/.config/dline/config.yaml` to your choosing.
5. Launch with `dline` (if you installed with pip) or ./dline.py (Running in repo
   folder)

### Color Customization
------------------------

Almost all aspects of the client can be colored to the user's wishes. You can set
these colors from within
`~/.config/dline/config.yaml`

Note: These assume that you're using the standard terminal colors. If you have colors
already defined in your ~/.Xresources or similar, this will be very confusing.

## Launching
------------------------
dline uses git for automatic updates, so you must be within the dline directory upon
starting. Manually you can launch via `python3.7 ./dline.py`, however it is advised
to create a helper script to do this for you.

### A Note On Emojis
-------------------------

Currently *most* of the standard unicode emojis are displaying. Note your terminal
must be able to render these symbols *and* you must be using a font set that contains
them. Because some of the emojis that discord uses are non-standard, they may not
display properly. Here is an example of a random few.

Custom emojis however, are displayed as :emoji_name:

### Note On Font Support
-------------------------

Like emojis, not all terminals and fonts support italic/bold/underline and
'background' colors, (which are used for \`code\`).  If these features aren't working
for you, odds are you are not using a supported terminal/font. Experiment with
different setups to see what works.

*Letting me know what setups __don't__ work helps a lot!*

### Dude this is awesome! How can I support the project?
--------------------------------------------------------

Star it! ðŸŒŸ

It helps to get it higher in GitHub's search results as well as making me feel good
inside. ;)

If you'd like to contribute, pull requests are __*always*__ welcome!

If you would like to get more info on what could be done or to discuss the project in
general, come join the Discord guild at: https://discord.gg/HWY2dDg. You can also try
joining Discline's guild (which this project is a fork of) here:
https://discord.gg/rBGQMTk.

### FAQ
-------------------------

> Yet another discord cli?

I didn't like any of the implementations I found around github. Too buggy.  Too
bloated. Bad UI. No customization. Some, after discord updates, no longer functioning
at all.

> Why use a token and not email/password?

Discord's API __does__ allow for email/pass login, but if you were to have 2FA, (2
factor authentication), enabled on your account, Discord would interpret this as a
malicious attack against your account and disable it.

So, because *"Nobody reads the readme"*, I have disabled this.

> How should I submit a GitHub issue?

Try to include this format:

```
OS: Linux/Debian
Terminal: urxvt
Font: source code pro
Python Version: 3.6
How to reproduce: xxxxxx
```

> It says my python is out of date even though I have 3.5+ installed?

Probably because you have multiple versions installed. Try running with
`python3.5` or `python3.6` rather than just "python3"

> I'm getting weird encoding errors on startup

You probably don't have UTF-8 set. If you're using Linux, look up how to do this
according to your distro.

If you're on BSD, add this to your /etc/profile:

```
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
export LESSCHARSET=utf-8
```

and make sure it gets sourced upon opening your terminal.

### Misc Screenshots
--------------------------

It can even be configured to hide most elements of the UI in the config:

### Known Bugs
--------------------------

> My bug isn't listed here, how can I voice my problem?

If you have a specific issue that isn't listed here or in the wiki, post a github
issue with a detailed explanation and I can try to get it fixed. Join the discord if
you want live help.

See my [webpage](https://natosaka.host/dline.html) for more information on bugs.

### Token Warning
-------------------------------
Do *NOT* share your token with anybody, if someone else gets ahold of your token,
they may control your account. If you are someone who keeps their ~/.config on
github, **add your token to your .gitignore**.  Otherwise it will become public.

### Legal Disclaimer
--------------------------------

Discord hasn't put out any official statement on whether using their API for 3rd
party clients is allowed or not. They *have* said that using their API to make
"self-bots" is against their ToS. By self-bots, it is my understanding they mean
automating non-bot accounts as bots.  My code has no automated functions, or any
on_events that provide features not included in the official client.

As far as I know, nobody has been banned for using things like this before, but
Discord might one day change their mind. With this said, I take **no** responsibility
if this gets you banned.
