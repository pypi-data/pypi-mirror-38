Bibliography
============

.. This file is named zzz_bibliography.rst so that it is the last in
   alphabetical order. This is needed so that sphinx handles it as the last
   file and takes into account all the references. See:
   http://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html
          #issue-unresolved-citations
              
.. There is a problem with the bibfile project.bib from ltfat octave project.
   One entry contains a '%' sign. This entry needs to be modified so that the
   generation with sphinx works. See:
   http://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html
          #encoding-percent-signs
