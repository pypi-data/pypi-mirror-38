Darr is a Python science library for storing and sharing numeric data arrays
in a way that is open, simple, and self-explanatory. It also enables fast
memory-mapped read/write access to such disk-based data, the ability to append
data, and the flexible use of metadata. It is primarily designed for
scientific use cases. Save and use your numeric arrays and metadata with one
line of code while long-term and tool-independent accessibility and easy
shareability is ensured.

To avoid dependency on specific tools, Darr is based on a combination of
flat binary and human-readable text files. It automatically saves a clear
text description of how the data is stored, together with code for reading
the specific data in a variety of current scientific data tools such as
Python, R, Julia, IDL, Matlab, Maple, and Mathematica (see `example array
<https://github.com/gbeckers/Darr/tree/master/examplearray.darr>`__).

Darr is currently pre-1.0, still undergoing significant development. It is
open source and freely available under the `New BSD License
<https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__ terms.

Features
--------

Pro's:

-  **Transparent data format** based on **flat binary** and **text**
   files.
-  Supports **very large data arrays** through **memory-mapped** file
   access.
-  Data read/write access through **NumPy indexing** (see
   `here <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html>`__).
-  Data is easily **appendable**.
-  **Human-readable explanation of how the binary data is stored** is
   saved in a README text file.
-  README also contains **examples of how to read the array** in popular
   analysis environments such as Python (without Darr), R, Julia,
   Octave/Matlab, GDL/IDL, and Mathematica.
-  **Many numeric types** are supported: (u)int8-(u)int64,
   float16-float64, complex64, complex128.
-  Easy use of **metadata**, stored in a separate
   `JSON <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`__ text file.
-  **Minimal dependencies**, only `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__.
-  **Integrates easily** with the
   `Dask <https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/>`__ or
   `NumExpr <https://numexpr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ libraries for
   **numeric computation on very large Darr arrays**.

Con's:

-  **No compression**, although it is of course possible to simply
   compress the darr files with a compression tool for archiving
   purposes.
-  **Multiple files**. The data, the data description, and the metadata
   are stored in separate files, though all within a single directory.
-  **Inefficient (storage-wise) for very small arrays**. If you have a
   zillion small arrays, and storage space in a concern, use other
   approaches.


Installation
------------

Darr depends on Python 3.6 or higher and NumPy 1.12 or higher.

Install Darr from PyPI::

    $ pip install darr
