About
-----

Single-shot positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (SSPALS) [Ref.
1] essentially consists of studying the number of annihilation
gamma-rays measured as a function of time following implantation of a
time-focused (~5 ns) positron bunch into a solid target material.

For certain materials a significant fraction of the positrons (~ 30%)
will bind to electrons to form positronium (Ps), which can then be
re-emitted to vacuum. Ps has a characteristic mean lifetime of 142 ns in
vacuum, which makes it relatively easy to identify in SSPALS spectra.

This package includes a handful of useful tools for working with SSPALS
data. The two main functions are used to: (i) combine data split across
hi/ low gain channels of a digital oscilloscope, and (ii) to estimate
the amount of Ps formed using the so-called delayed fraction.

*sspals.chmx(hi, low)* > Remove zero offset from hi and low gain data,
invert and splice together by swapping saturated values from the hi-gain
channel for those from the low-gain channel. Apply along rows of a 2D
array.

*sspals.sspals(arr, dt, limits=[A, B, C])* > Calculate the trigger time
t0 (using a cfd) and the delayed fraction (DF) (integral B->C / integral
A->C) for each row of a 2D array. Return a pandas DataFrame [(t0, AC,
BC, DF)].

Raw data (hi, low) is expected to be 2D arrays of repeat measurements,
where each row contains a single SSPALS waveform.
