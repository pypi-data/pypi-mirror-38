    Parameters
    ----------
    source : (Segment, data) iterator or SlidingWindowFeature
        e.g. MFCC features
    target : Segment iterator
        e.g. sliding window to extract sequences of MFCC features
    process_func : callable, optional
        Takes a (n_samples, n_features) numpy-array as input.
        Returns a (n_samples, n_output) numpy-array.
        E.g. a seq2seq neural network
    agg_func : callable
        Takes a (n_overlap, n_samples, n_output) numpy-array as input
        Returns a (n_samples, n_output) numpy-array.
        E.g. np.nanmean(..., axis=0)
