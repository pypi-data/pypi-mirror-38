def random_label_index(y, per_label=3, repeat=True, return_label=False):
    """

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : iterable
    per_label : int, optional
        Defaults to 3.
    repeat : bool, optional
        Default behavior is to repeat sequences for labels that have less than
        `per_label` different samples. Set to False to not repeat sequences
        (side effect is that the generator may yield less than `per_label`
        samples for some labels.
    return_label : bool, optional
        Default behavior is to only yield sequence indices. Set to True to
        yield (indice, label) tuples.
