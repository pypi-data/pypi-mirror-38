Description: # bfit
        Beta-NMR GUI for reading, drawing, fitting data. 
        
        ## Run Instructions
        
        To run, call `python3 -m bfit`
        
        ## Setup after Install
        
        Install is done simply by `pip install bfit`. Afterwards, you may want to tell bfit where the data is stored. This is done by defining environment variables
        `BNMR_ARCHIVE` and `BNQR_ARCHIVE` (for convenience add this to your .bashrc script). The expected file format is as follows: 
        
            /path/
                bnmr/
                bnqr/
                    2017/
                    2018/
                        045123.msr
        
        In this example, you would set `BNQR_ARCHIVE=/path/bnqr/` to the directory containing the year directories.
            
        ## A Tour of the GUI
        
        ### Menu bar: 
        
        * **File**
            * Calculator for B0 in BNQR 
            * Calculator for B1 in BNMR
            * Export fetched data asymmetries to csv file
        * **Settings**
            * Set data directory. Defaults to environment variables `BNMR_ARCHIVE` and `BNQR_ARCHIVE`
            * Set matplotlib drawing defaults
            * Set other drawing defaults: markers, lines, etc. 
            * Dynamically load user-written fitting routines. 
            * Set auto update redraw period. 
            * Set names of histograms used in asymmetry calculations.
        * **Redraw Mode**
            * Set drawing mode.
        * **Help**
            * Show help wiki.
        
        ### Tabs:
        
        * **File Details**
            * File inspector. Use this to quickly view the contents and parameters of a given run. Use `return` to fetch and `ctrl+return` to quickly draw. 
        * **Fetch Data**
            * Fetch many data files for quick superposition and to set up fitting routines. Data fetched here will be fitted on the next tab. 
        * **Fit Data**
            * Fit the fetched data, and set fitting parameters. 
            * View the fit parameters and draw as functions of each other.
