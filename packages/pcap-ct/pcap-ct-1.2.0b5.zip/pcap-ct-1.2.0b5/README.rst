pcap-ct
=======

Python wrapper for the *pcap* library.

Overview
========

| Python *pcap-ct* package is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper
  for *libpcap* C library - the current tcpdump.org version, and the WinPcap
  port for Windows..
|
| *pcap-ct* is a pure Python package, based on the low-level
  `libcap <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libpcap>`__ package.
| It is fully compliant implementation of the original
  `PyPCAP <https://github.com/pynetwork/pypcap>`__ 1.2.0 API (with some minor
  improvements and bug fixes) by implementing whole its functionality in a
  clean Python instead of Cython and C.

About original PyPCAP:

Borrowed from the `original website <http://pypcap.readthedocs.org>`__:

PyPCAP
------

This is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper for libpcap -
the current tcpdump.org version, and the WinPcap port for Windows.

Example use::

    >>> import pcap
    >>> sniffer = pcap.pcap(name=None, promisc=True, immediate=True, timeout_ms=50)
    >>> addr = lambda pkt, offset: '.'.join(str(ord(pkt[i])) for i in range(offset, offset + 4))
    >>> for ts, pkt in sniffer:
    ...     print('%d\tSRC %-16s\tDST %-16s' % (ts, addr(pkt, sniffer.dloff + 12), addr(pkt, sniffer.dloff + 16)))
    ...

Windows notes
-------------

WinPcap has compatibility issues with Windows 10, therefore
it's recommended to use `Npcap <https://nmap.org/npcap/>`_
(Nmap's packet sniffing library for Windows, based on the WinPcap/Libpcap libraries,
but with improved speed, portability, security, and efficiency).
Please enable WinPcap API-compatible mode during the library installation.
