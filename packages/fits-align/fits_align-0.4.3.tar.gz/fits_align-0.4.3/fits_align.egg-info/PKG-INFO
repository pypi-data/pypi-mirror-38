Description: # FITS Align
        
        Align a sequence of astronomical FITS files based on sources extracted in each image. The aligned files will be geometrically reprojected so all the images are the same size and shape.
        
        It is designed to work exclusively with reduced data from [Las Cumbres Observatory](https://lco.global). FITS data from LCO is [Rice compressed](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fpack/) and contains sources extracted using [SEP](https://sep.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.x/) during our data pipeline processing.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Download this repository :
        `python setup.py install`
        
        
        ## Example usage
        
        ```python
        from fits_align.ident import make_transforms
        from fits_align.align import affineremap
        from glob import glob
        from numpy import shape
        
        tmp_dir = "<FULL PATH TO INPUT FILES>"
        
        img_list = sorted(glob(os.path.join(tmp_dir,"*.fz")))
        ref_image = img_list[0]
        images_to_align = img_list[1:]
        
        identifications = make_transforms(ref_image, images_to_align)
        
        aligned_images = [ref_image]
        for id in identifications:
            if id.ok:
                alignedimg = affineremap(id.ukn.filepath, id.trans, outdir=tmpdir)
                aligned_images.append(alignedimg)
        
        ```
        
        ## About
        
        This is a customised fork of [AliPy by Malte Tewes](http://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/alipy/). I have removed the dependency on SciPy in favour of pure NumPy (for linear algebra) and Pillow (for image array transforms).
