# Popelines

This is a simple ETL tool for BigQuery, named for the author's surname. 

Popelines provides some basic functionality, such as writing to line-delimited JSON, writing to BigQuery, chunking dates, and other tools that are often needed when writing an ETL. It's sparse now, but I plan to expand it to include other Google Cloud functionalities.
