prelude: |
    This release adds the :class:`~.status.Status` class. This is quite a big addition in that
    it introduces a separate thread for managing subscriptions to the SkyQ's
    websocket services via the :py:mod:`asyncio`-based websockets_ module.

    .. _websockets: https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets
features:
  - The library can now report whether the SkyQ box is in Standby Mode or Online.
issues:
  - not all possible statuses on the WS endpoint have been figured out yet.
  - this is really an *extremely minimal* implementation from a feature standpoint, but it at least proves
    the async-cum-thread design works. More work is needed to subscribe to other webocket- and uPNP-based event
    streams.

    test coverage of :class:`~.status.Status` is not great due to the difficulty in mocking
    all the various websocket protocol events. A separate issue (27_) has been opend to follow up on this,
    but in the interests of making progress, we are proceeding with this inferior test coverage.
