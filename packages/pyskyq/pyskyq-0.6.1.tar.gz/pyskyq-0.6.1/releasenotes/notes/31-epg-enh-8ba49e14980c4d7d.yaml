    This release adds much better EPG support through the addition of channel
    and programme data from www.xmltv.co.uk (or any other XMLTV source). With
    the addition of a number of new classes, it's now possible to load XMLTV
    into the ``EPG`` on demand, or via a schedule and have it integrate
    seamlessly with data obtained directly from the SkyQ box.


    This has resulted in a refactoring and clean up of a number of other parts
    of the codebase, including a major rework of all asyncio-based coroutines to
    operate in a separate dedicated thread (:class:`~.asyncthread.AsyncThread`).
    The rationale for this, apart from general tidying up, is to provide a
    synchronous API to users whilst still taking advantage of asyncio, as well
    as to separate the internal event from any others that the calling code
    might employ in the main thread.
features:
  - Added the :class:`~.xmltvlisting.XMLTVListing` class to download and
    parse XMLTV feeds.
  - Added cron-style scheduling through the introduction of
    class:`~.cronthread.CronThread` - this is used to scheduled the download of
    XMLTV listings.
  - Generalised :class:`~.channel.Channel` to support data from multiple sources
    and made some factory functions to generate Channels from various sources.
  - Added channel merge function to enable a new channel to be created using
    merged data from both the XML TV and SkyQ sources.
  - Introduced a :class:`~.asyncthread.AsyncThread` to manage asyncio event loops
    in a separate thread and refactored all async calls throughout the library to
    run in this thread.
  - Added JSON Encoding/Decoding for Channels & EPG.
fixes:
  - Massively improved test coverage for :class:`~.epg.EPG` and made the
    tests more granular.
  - Made a better ``__repr__()`` for EPG, Channel and a few other classe to make
    debugging easier.
  - Fixed Sphinx layout, coroutine support, and ordering. Much improved module
    documentation also.
  - Made :class:`~.channel.Channel` immutable and ``Hashable`` to facilitate
    easier management of lists of Channels.
  - Added :class:`.constants.QUALITY` for representing the various channel
    quality types (``HD``, ``SD``, ``AU``).
  - Refactored :class:`~.status.Status` to use :class:`~.asyncthread.AsyncThread`.
  - Simplified fetching of channel data from both summary and detail SkyQ endpoints
    in :meth:`.epg.load_skyq_channel_data` to load the detail data on the fly rather
    than after all summary channel data was downloaded.
