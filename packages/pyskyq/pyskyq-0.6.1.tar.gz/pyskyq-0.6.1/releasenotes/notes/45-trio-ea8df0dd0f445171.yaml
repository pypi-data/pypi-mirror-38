prelude: |
    The major change in this release is to move off ``asyncio`` for a number of
    reasons and onto trio_ as the preferred async library.

    .. _trio: https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
features:
  - Implemented :func:`pyskyq.status.get_status()` async context manager for
    accessing the status of the SkyQ box.
  - added explicit support for gzipped XMLTV payloads.
issues:
  - |
    Had to monkeypatch the ``h11`` HTTP/1.1 Sans-IO library to force a specific
    case on the ``Upgrade:`` websocket header due to SkyQ not liking all lower-
    case headers that are the default from ``h11``. See here_ for the details.

    .. _here: https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/issues/31

upgrade:
deprecations:
  - |
    Removed ``AsyncThread`` - not needed with ``trio``.
  - Crontab support removed from EPG -- its better to be implemented outside the
    library or even just as a unix cronjob -- no sense re-inventing a perfectly
    good wheel.
  - Removed ``pyskyq.status.Status.standby`` and replaced it with
    :attr:`pyskyq.status.Status.online`.
fixes:
  - |
    Got rid of a lot of now superfluous ``asyncio`` related test packages.
  - |
    Fixed all relevant example scripts to use ``trio``.
  - Improved test coverage to 100% :)
other:
  - |
    Got so p*ssed off with RTD not supporting Python 3.7 in their build process
    that in the end I followeed ``Quart``'s example and just serve the docs now
    via GitHub Pages.
