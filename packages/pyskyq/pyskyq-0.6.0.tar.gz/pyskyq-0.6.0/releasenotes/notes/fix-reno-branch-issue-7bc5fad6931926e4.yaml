prelude: >
    This ia quite a big bump, chiefly because it introduces use of :py:mod:`asyncio` and
    other Python 3.7 features. The main addition is the introduction of the :class:`~.epg.EPG`
    and :class:`~.channel.Channel` classes, which provide access to channel datails
    (name, number, HD/SD, description, etc).


    It **does not** (yet) provide the actual EPG programme data.
features:
  - Added :class:`~.channel.Channel` class.
  - Added :class:`~.epg.EPG` which contains a list of :class:`~.channel.Channel` objects.

    .. _15: https://gitlab.com/bradwood/pyskyq/issues/15
fixes:
  - sorted out GitLab CI jobs to run coverage and unit tests on master branch.
  - made badges work properly and be branch-aware
upgrade:
  - Upgraded minimum Python version to 3.7 due to the use of newer :py:mod:`asyncio` features.
other:
  - tidied up some of the tests, including mocking the SkyQ Box REST API
  - fixed up all the tests that were breaking due to missing mocks on the REST API
  - changed the call signature for :meth:`~.skyq.SkyQ.__init__` to force use of keyword arguments
    for optional parameters.
