    Overhauled the logging implementation to make it well-behaved for a library.

    See issue 17_ for details, but essentially, we are no longer passing loggers
    around, but instead instantiating module-local loggers.
    The the top-level `__init__.py` sets up a :py:class:`logging.NullHandler`
    so that logs are suppressed by default unless the calling application sets up
    a more verbose handler after the point at which this package is imported.
