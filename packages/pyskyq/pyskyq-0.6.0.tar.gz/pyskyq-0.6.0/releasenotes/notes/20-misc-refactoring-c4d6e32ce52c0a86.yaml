prelude: >
    Substantial refactoring and removal of code-bloat.
features:
  - Added ``examples`` directory with a few simple example scripts included.
  - |
    Added the :func:`~.remote.press_remote` function as a replacement for
    the deprecated ``SkyRemote`` class.
deprecations:
  - |
    Removed the ``skyq`` object as it is just a container for the other classes and
    *Flat is better than nested*.
  - Removed the ``setup.py`` generated cli entry-point and migrated the cli tool
    previously shipped to an example script.
  - Removed the ``SkyRemote`` class as it's a class with just one method, so really,
    it should just be a function.
