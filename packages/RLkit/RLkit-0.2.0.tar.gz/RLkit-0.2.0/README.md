# RLkit: A simple Reinforcement Learning library

This project is still a work in progress. More algorithms and detailed documentation coming soon :)

Currently supported agents-

1. Random agent
2. REINFORCE (Policy Gradients)
3. DQN
4. DQN with baseline
5. Actor-Critic

See examples for details on how to use the library.

Requirements-
```
tensorflow==1.11.0
gym==0.10.8
numpy==1.15.4
```

## New in v0.2
- Added DQN and DQN with baseline agents
- Added ActorCritic agent
- Added support for various activation functions


## Upcoming
- Duelling DQN
