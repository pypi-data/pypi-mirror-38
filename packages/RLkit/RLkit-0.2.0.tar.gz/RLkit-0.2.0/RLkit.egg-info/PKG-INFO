Description: # RLkit: A simple Reinforcement Learning library
        
        This project is still a work in progress. More algorithms and detailed documentation coming soon :)
        
        Currently supported agents-
        
        1. Random agent
        2. REINFORCE (Policy Gradients)
        3. DQN
        4. DQN with baseline
        5. Actor-Critic
        
        See examples for details on how to use the library.
        
        Requirements-
        ```
        tensorflow==1.11.0
        gym==0.10.8
        numpy==1.15.4
        ```
        
        ## New in v0.2
        - Added DQN and DQN with baseline agents
        - Added ActorCritic agent
        - Added support for various activation functions
        
        
        ## Upcoming
        - Duelling DQN
        - Support for logging and plotting
        - Support for adding seeds
        - Support for custom environments
