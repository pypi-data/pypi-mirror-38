        :param job_id: will be the name of the list which the worker
        appends the finished scraper object to in newt.db, for example, if the
        job_name is 'testing' then the jobs will be added to the `testing` scrape_list.

        :param scraper: the Scraper class object like `BooksToScrapeScraper`

        ::param http_session: dict(), specialized session args. Example,
        some scraper implementation may require to define a custom landing page
        url and also need fine control over the timeouts. So the http_session would
        look like http_session={'url': <landing page url>, 'timeout' : (3.05, 1200.05)}

        :param kwargs: generally only needed to support customized scraper
        implementations. For example, if your scraper logic depends on some flag,
        like china=True, which might define whether or not a .com.cn domain is
        scraped, instead of just the .com domain. Use kwargs as needed here, to
        execute based on your customized scraper logic.

        :param kwargs: qtimeout: to adjust the queue timeout like {"qtimeout":5} which
        you should probably never adjust this. But, if you do adjust this, ensure that
        the worker's qtimeout is less than the manager's qtimeout.
