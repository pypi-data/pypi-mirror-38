    Casting returned objects to string can ensure they do not inadvertently contain
    a BS4 object, which presents difficulties in pickling which can be hard to debug.
    If you do use newt.db, scrape objects can be tested with newt.db.jsonpickle
    `dumps` function, to ensure that the object can be both pickled and also
    serialized to json by newt.db and indexed/saved in a PostgreSQL jsonb field.
