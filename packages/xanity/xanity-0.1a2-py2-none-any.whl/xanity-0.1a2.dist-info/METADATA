#  xanity is a tool for experimentation

Xanity is meant to allow easy and free creation of multiple experiments which
share some codebase similarity.

Xanity helps manage the following:
 - experiment source code
 - analysis source code
 - experiment parameters
 - experiment data

Usage:
1. initialize $PWD (or create a new xanity directory) with:

    `xanity init [new_directory]`

    this will create a skeleton directory tree for your experiments and analyses.

2. find the conda-environment.yaml file and tweak its contents to suit your requiremnts.
3. resolve these requirements (create/update a conda env) with: 

    `xanity setup`

4. create/edit experiments inside xanity-project-root/experiments (see below for experiment file skeleton):

    `nano experiments/myfaveexp.py`

5. run experiments (individually or collectively):
    * `xanity run`  this will run everything
    * `xanity run myfaveexp`  this will run the exp found inside experiments/myfaveexp.py
    * `xanity run myfaveexp experiment1` this will run the two experiments given
    * `python -m experiment/myfaveexp` this is an example of running an experiment directly
    * `python experiment/myfaveexp` this is another example of running an experiment directly

6. you will find all the experimental data organized under the data/runs directory tree.
   Source-code snapshots are tarred and kept with the data they produced. Logs are kept too.

7. you can run an analysis script on a completed run:

    `xanity [analyze|anal] myfaveexp [-d run_data_root_dir]`

   this will look for the most recent (or specified) dir of run data, and run the analysis found
   at analyses/myfaveexp on that data.

8. relax. collect Nobel.

# Experiment file skeleton:
## (xanity-proj-root/experiments/*.py)

a. Each experiment module must have a main() function defined:
  - (xanity will look for and invoke the main() function in each experiment).
  - Any parameters to the experiment should be arguments to the main().
  (leaving the experiment exposed in the module makes your code more portable.. I think.
  an alternative would be to define an experiment class inside xanity and make each experiment an instance)

b. The `xanity.experiment.parameters()` call registers the parameter permutations to use when running the experiment.

c. Include the `xanity.metadata_hook()` and `xanity.run_hook()` function calls.
    - The metadata_hook will return relevant xanity metadata (loggers, data paths, etc)
    - The run_hook will run the experiment if it's invoked directly as a script or as a module:

```python
# experiments/example_experiment.py

import xanity.experiment

xanity.experiment.parameters({
        'iterations': [5, 6, 7],
        'max_headroom': [98, 99, 100],
})

def main(iterations=5, max_headroom=99):
    metadata = xanity.experiment.metadata_hook()
    do_my_experiment(iterations, max_headroom)

xanity.experiment.run_hook()
```

# Analysis file skeleton:
## (xanity-proj-root/analyses/*.py)

a. Each analysis module must have a main() function defined:
  - (xanity will look for and invoke the main() function in each analysis).
  - The only parameter to the analysis is the path to the root of a run (or set of runs).
  (leaving the experiment exposed in the module makes your code more portable.. I think.
  an alternative would be to define an experiment class inside xanity and make each experiment an instance)

b. The call to xanity.analysis.link_experiments() registers the names of experiments to associate with this analysis.

c. Include the `xanity.analysis.metadata_hook()` and `xanity.analysis.run_hook()` function calls.
    - The metadata_hook will return relevant xanity metadata (loggers, data paths, etc)
    - The run_hook will run the analysis if it's invoked directly as a script or as a module

```python
# analyses/example_analysis.py

import xanity.analysis

xanity.analysis.link_experiments(['myfaveexp','experiment1'])

def main(data_root=None):
    metadata=xanity.analysis.metadata_hook()
    do_my_analysis(data_root)

xanity.analysis.run_hook()
```
