"""
Intelligent Sensing Toolbox (ISensing) is a Python package that focus on analytics of massive nodes. This toolbox
includes multiple open-source machine learning algorithms such as Alpha-Hull, High Density Regions, IsolationForest
and RobustPCA.

In data analytic, making sense of massive numbers of data nodes requires machine learning to work on datasets from
multiple sources in order to generate insights. For situation where a node that generates data points of multiple
features in time series format, massive number of nodes will make anaylsis for more challenging. Intelligent Sensing
Toolbox collects different algorithms to handle multivariate time series analysis to provide analytics for outliers 
detection, clustering or prediction.
