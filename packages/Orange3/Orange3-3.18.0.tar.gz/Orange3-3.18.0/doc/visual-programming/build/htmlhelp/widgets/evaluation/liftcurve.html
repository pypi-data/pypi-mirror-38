<p>The <strong>Lift curve</strong> shows the relation between the number of instances which
were predicted positive and those that are indeed positive and
thus measures the performance of a chosen classifier against a random
classifier. The graph is constructed with the cumulative number of cases
(in descending order of probability) on the x-axis and the cumulative
number of true positives on the y-axis. Lift curve is often used in
segmenting the population, e.g., plotting the number of responding
customers against the number of all customers contacted. You can also
determine the optimal classifier and its threshold from the graph.</p>

<li><em>Show lift convex hull</em> plots a convex hull over lift curves for all

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>At the moment, the only widget which gives the right type of the signal
needed by the <strong>Lift Curve</strong> is <a class="reference internal" href="testandscore.html"><span class="doc">Test&amp;Score</span></a>.</p>
<p>In the example below, we try to see the prediction quality for the class
‘survived’ on the <em>Titanic</em> dataset. We compared three different
classifiers in the Test Learners widget and sent them to Lift Curve to see
their performance against a random model. We see the <a class="reference internal" href="../model/tree.html"><span class="doc">Tree</span></a> classifier is the best out of the three, since it best aligns
with <em>lift convex hull</em>. We also see that its performance is the best
for the first 30% of the population (in order of descending
probability), which we can set as the threshold for optimal
classification.</p>
