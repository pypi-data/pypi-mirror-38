<p>The <strong>Continuize</strong> widget receives a dataset in the input and outputs the
same dataset in which the discrete attributes (including binary attributes)
are replaced with continuous ones.</p>

<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction" target="_blank">Continuization methods</a>, which define the treatment of multivalued discrete attributes. Say that we have a discrete attribute status with the values low, middle and high, listed in that order. Options for their transformation are:<ul>
<li><strong>Target or First value as base</strong>: the attribute will be transformed into two continuous attributes, status=middle with values 0 or 1 signifying whether the original attribute had value middle on a particular example, and similarly, status=high. Hence, a three-valued attribute is transformed into two continuous attributes, corresponding to all except the first value of the attribute.</li>
<li><strong>Most frequent value as base</strong>: similar to the above, except that the data is analyzed and the most frequent value is used as a base. So, if most examples have the value middle, the two newly constructed continuous attributes will be status=low and status=high.</li>
<li><strong>One attribute per value</strong>: this would construct three continuous attributes out of a three-valued discrete one.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore multinominal attributes</strong>: removes the multinominal attributes from the data.</li>
<li><strong>Treat as ordinal</strong>: converts the attribute into a continuous attribute with values 0, 1, and 2.</li>
<li><strong>Divide by number of values</strong>: same as above, except that the values are normalized into range 0-1. So, our case would give values 0, 0.5 and 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define the treatment of continuous attributes. You will usually
prefer the <em>Leave them as they are</em> option. The alternative is <em>Normalize by
span</em>, which will subtract the lowest value found in the data and
divide by the span, so all values will fit into [0, 1]. Finally,
<em>Normalize by standard deviation</em> subtracts the average and divides by the
deviation.</li>
<li>Define the treatment of class attributes. Besides leaving it as it
is, there are also a couple of options available for
multinominal attributes, except for those options which split the
attribute into more than one attribute - this obviously cannot be
supported since you cannot have more than one class attribute.</li>
<li>With <em>value range</em>, you can define the values of new attributes.
In the above text, we supposed the range <em>from 0 to 1</em>. You can change
it to <em>from -1 to 1</em>.</li>
<li>Produce a report.</li>
<li>If <em>Apply automatically</em> is ticked, changes are committed automatically.
Otherwise, you have to press <em>Apply</em> after each change.</li>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>First, let’s see what is the output of the <strong>Continuize</strong> widget. We feed the
original data (the <em>Heart disease</em> dataset) into the <a class="reference internal" href="datatable.html"><span class="doc">Data Table</span></a> and see how they look like. Then
we continuize the discrete values and observe them in another <a class="reference internal" href="datatable.html"><span class="doc">Data
Table</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>In the second example, we show a typical use of this widget - in order to
properly plot the linear projection of the data, discrete attributes need to
be converted to continuous ones and that is why we put the data through the
<strong>Continuize</strong> widget before drawing it. The attribute “<em>chest pain</em>”
originally had four values and was transformed into three continuous
attributes; similar happened to gender, which was transformed into a
single attribute “<em>gender=female</em>”.</p>
