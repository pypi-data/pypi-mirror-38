PyHELP is an object oriented Python library that provides a set of tools to evaluate spatially distributed groundwater recharge at the regional scale using the HELP model. This work is based on the method that was originally developed by Croteau et al. (2011) to assess spatially distributed groundwater recharge in the Chateauguay River Watershed, Quebec, Canada.
