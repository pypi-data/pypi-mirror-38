# lunasync tag search subscriptions

# Each line represents a tag search to download and keep synchronized.
# Blank lines and lines starting with a "#" (comments) are ignored.
#
# Lines are comma-separated values:
#     tag search, filter, labels, booru
#
# A value can be left unspecified, blank, or the symbol "%". Effects:
# - tag search: will report the latest posts/home page of the booru;
# - filter:     no filter will be applied;
# - labels:     no label will be set;
# - booru:      the default booru (set in lunafind's config file) will be used.
#
# As example, the following lines are equivalent
# (assuming the default booru is "danbooru"):
#     wallpaper width:>=1920
#     wallpaper width:>=1920, , ,
#     wallpaper width:>=1920, %, %, %
#     wallpaper width:>=1920, %, %, danbooru
#
# See `lunasync --help` and `lunafind --help` for more information.
