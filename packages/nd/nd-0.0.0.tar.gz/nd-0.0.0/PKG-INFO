        # nd
        
        This package contains a selection of tools to handle and analyze satellite data.
        
        `nd` is making heavy use of the `xarray` library. `dask` is used for parallelization.
        
        The GDAL library is only used as a compatibility layer in `nd.io` to enable reading supported file formats.
        Internally, all data is passed around as `xarray` Datasets and all provided functions expect this format as inputs.
        `nd.io.from_gdal_dataset` may be used to convert any `gdal.Dataset` object or GDAL-readable file into an `xarray` Dataset.

        ## Submodules
        
        ### nd.io
        Several functions to read and write satellite data.
        * to/from NetCDF
        * read data from open GDAL datasets and any GDAL-readable file
        * deal with complex-valued data (not supported by NetCDF) by disassembling into two reals when writing to NetCDF, and vice versa when reading.
        
        
        ### nd.change
        A module implementing change detection algorithms.
        * convert dual polarization data into the complex covariance matrix representation
        * OmnibusTest (change detection algorithm by Conradsen et al. (2015))
        
        
        ### nd.classify
        A collection of classification and clustering methods.
        
        ... *work in progress* ...
        
        
        ### nd.filter
        Implements several filters, currently:
        * kernel convolutions
        * non-local means
        
        
        ### nd.utils
        Several utility functions.
        * split/merge numpy arrays, xarray datasets, ...
        * parallelize operations acting on xarray datasets
        
        
        ### nd.warp
        Given a dataset with Ground Control Points (GCPs), usually in the form of a tie point grid,
        warp the dataset onto an equirectangular projection (WGS84), such that lat/lon directly correspond to the
        y and x coordinates, respectively.
        
        This makes concatenating datasets easier and reduces storage size, because lat/lon coordinates
        do not need to be stored for each pixel.
        
        
        ### nd.visualize
        Several functions to quickly visualize data.
        * create RGB images from data
        * create video from a spatiotemporal dataset
        
        
        ### nd.tiling
        * Split a dataset into tiles.
        * Read a tiled dataset.
        * Map a function across a tiled dataset.
        * Create and merge tiles with buffer to avoid edge affects.
