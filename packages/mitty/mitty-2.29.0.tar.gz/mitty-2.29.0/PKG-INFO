Description: Mitty is a data simulator meant to help debug aligners and variant
        callers.
        
        It requires Python 3.4 or later. It is released under the
        Apache 2.0 license.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        -  Generate reads from the whole genome, a single tiny region or from a
           set of regions as desired
        -  Handles X, Y chromosomes and polyploidy IF the VCF GT field is
           properly set
        -  Read qname stores correct POS, CIGAR and the sizes of variants
           covered by the read
        -  Name of sample included in read allowing us to mix FASTQs from
           different simulations/sources
        
           -  Can mix viral contamination into reads
           -  Can do tumor/normal mixes
        
        -  Corruption module adds sequencing errors to reads
        
           -  Read models can be sampled from existing BAM files
        
        -  "God aligner" writes out a BAM with perfect alignments which can be
           used for BAM comparisons
        -  Simple genome simulator to generate VCFs with SNPs and different
           sizes of Insertions and Deletions for aligner/caller testing
        -  Analyze, plot and debug alignment accuracy with composable analysis functions
