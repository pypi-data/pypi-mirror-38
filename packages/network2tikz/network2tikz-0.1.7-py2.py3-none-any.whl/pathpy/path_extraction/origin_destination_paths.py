    """extracts shortest path statistics based on origin/destination data.
    Such data capture the statistics of the origin (i.e. the start node) and destination
    (i.e. the target) node of itineraries in a given network.

    Common examples include passenger origin and destination statistics in transportation
    networks. The methods in this class can be used to read  origin/destination data from
    a file and generate path statistics based on the assumption that all paths from an
    origin and a destination follow the shortest path in the network.

    Extracts pathway statistics by calculating shortest paths between all origin and
    destination pairs in a given network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    origin_destination_list: list
        a list of tuples (o, d, w) containing the origin (o), destination (d),
        and float weight (w) of paths.

        in the network must match the node names used in the origin destination list.
