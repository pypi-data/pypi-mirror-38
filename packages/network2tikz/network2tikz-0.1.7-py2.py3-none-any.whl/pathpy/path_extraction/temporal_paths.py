    """
    Calculates the frequency of all time-respecting paths up to maximum length
    of maxLength, assuming a maximum temporal distance of delta between consecutive
    time-stamped links on a path. This (static) method returns an instance of the
    class Paths, which can subsequently be used to generate higher-order network
    representations based on the path statistics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tempnet : pathpy.TemporalNetwork
        TemporalNetwork to extract the path from
    delta : int
        Indicates the maximum temporal distance up to which time-stamped
        links will be considered to contribute to time-respecting paths.
        For (u, v;3) and (v,w;7) a time-respecting path (u,v)->(v,w) will be inferred
        for all 0 < delta <= 4, while no time-respecting path will be inferred for all
        delta > 4. If the max time diff is not set specifically, the default value of
        delta=1 will be used, meaning that a time-respecting path u -> v -> w will
        only be inferred if there are *directly consecutive* time-stamped links
        (u,v;t) (v,w;t+1). Every time-stamped edge is further considered a path of
        length one, i.e. for maxLength=1 this function will simply return the
        statistics of time-stamped edges.
    max_length : int
        Indicates the maximum length up to which time-respecting paths should be
        calculated, which can be limited due to computational efficiency.
        A value of k will generate all time-respecting paths consisting of up to k
        time-stamped links. Note that generating a multi-order model with a maximum
        order of k requires to extract time-respecting paths with *at least* length k.
        If a limitation of the maxLength is not required for computational reasons,
        this parameter should not be set (as it will change the statistics of paths)
    max_subpath_length : int
        This can be used to limit the calculation of sub path statistics to a given
        maximum length. This is useful, as the statistics of sub paths of length k
        are only needed to fit a higher-order model with order k. Hence, if we know
        that the model selection is limited to a given maximum order K, we can safely
        set the maximum sub path length to K. By default, sub paths of any length
        will be calculated. Note that, independent of the sub path calculation
        longest path of any length will be considered in the likelihood calculation!
