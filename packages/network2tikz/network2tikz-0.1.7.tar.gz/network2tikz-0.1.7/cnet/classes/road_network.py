    Parameters
    ----------
    directed : Boole, optional  (default = True)

    [WARNING] No suitable coordinate was found for node "b"! Coordinate was set to "(0,0)"!
    [WARNING] No "capacity" attribute was found for edge ab! Default capacity value "1000" was used instead!

    y : float
        y position of the node. This property can be called, modified and set.

    coordinate : tuple of floats
        Tuple in form of (x,y), where x and y describe the position of the
        node. This property can be called, modified and set.

    Examples
    --------
    Create an empty node with out coordinate (not recommended but possible).

    >>> u = cn.RoadNode('u')
    [WARNING] No suitable coordinate was found for node "u"! Coordinate was set to "(0,0)"!

    Create a proper node

    >>> v = cn.RoadNode('u',x=1,y=2)
    >>> v.coordinate
    (1,2)
    >>> v.x
    1
    >>> v.y
    2

    Changing the coordinate

    >>> v.x = 3
    >>> v.coordinate
    (3,2)
    >>> v.coordinate = (4,4)
    >>> v.coordinate
    (4,4)
