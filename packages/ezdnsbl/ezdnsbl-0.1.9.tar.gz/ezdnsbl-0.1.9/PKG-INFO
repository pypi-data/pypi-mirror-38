Description: ======
        README
        ======
        
        A first stab at writing something that could be construed as a python script. Aims to simplify querying multiple DNSBLs.
        
        
        -----
        Setup
        -----
        
        1. Run setup.py
        2. Put your Project Honey Pot API token in `provider/httpbl_apikey.py` (use `httpbl_apikey.py.sample`) -OR- remove HTTBL from the ipv4 array in `provider/__init__.py`
        
        
        -----
        Usage
        -----
        
        Run the program with an argument of either an IP address, domain name, AS number, or MD5/SHA1 hash. If no argument is given, drop into a python shell with dnsbl_query imported as a library.
        
        Take a look at the source for more info.
        
        NOTE: This script makes NO ATTEMPT to rate-limit queries - it is up to YOU to ensure that your usage conforms to the various AUPs and terms of each of the providers listed below.
