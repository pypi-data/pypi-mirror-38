Description: ThreshingFloor CLI Quickstart Guide 
        ================================
        
        The ThreshingFloor CLI helps you separate the signal from the noise in your logfiles. If you are running a service that faces the internet, you likely see thousands of scans, bots, and brute force attempts every day. These scans clog up your log files, and make it hard to find legitimate events of interest.
        
        The ThreshingFloor CLI is a utility that leverages the ThreshingFloor API to reduce noisy entries from your log files. This tool is currently in ALPHA.
