    Fixed bug where the ORM annotations could be incorrect for the
    primaryjoin/secondaryjoin a relationship if one used the pattern
    ``ForeignKey(SomeClass.id)`` in the declarative mappings.   This pattern
    would leak undesired annotations into the join conditions which can break
    aliasing operations done within :class:`.Query` that are not supposed to
    impact elements in that join condition.  These annotations are now removed
    up front if present.
