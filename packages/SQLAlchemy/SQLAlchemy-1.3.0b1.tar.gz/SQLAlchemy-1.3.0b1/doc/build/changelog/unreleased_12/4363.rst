    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`4349` where adding the "secondary"
    table to the FROM clause for a dynamic loader would affect the ability of
    the :class:`.Query` to make a subsequent join to another entity.   The fix
    adds the primary entity as the first element of the FROM list since
    :meth:`.Query.join` wants to jump from that.   Version 1.3 will have
    a more comprehensive solution to this problem as well (:ticket:`4365`).
