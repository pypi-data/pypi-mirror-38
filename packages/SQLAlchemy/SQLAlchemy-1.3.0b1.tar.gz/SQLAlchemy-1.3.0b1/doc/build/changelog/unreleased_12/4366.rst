    In continuing with a similar theme as that of very recent :ticket:`4349`,
    repaired issue with :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.any` and
    :meth:`.RelationshipProperty.Comparator.has` where the "secondary"
    selectable needs to be explicitly part of the FROM clause in the
    EXISTS subquery to suit the case where this "secondary" is a :class:`.Join`
    object.
