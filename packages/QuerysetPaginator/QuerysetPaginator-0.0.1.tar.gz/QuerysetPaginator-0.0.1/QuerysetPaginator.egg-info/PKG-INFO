Description: ### Evaluated Queryset Paginator
        
        This python package has been developed in order to overcome the issues of the default `django.core.Paginator` which does not paginate the evaluate query sets properly.
        
        #### Functions
        
          * `__init__()`
            Constructor of the class which takes two parameters as input:
            1. `query_set`: The entire query set that needs to be paginated
            2. `objects_per_page`: The number of objects that are required for each page
        
          * `paginate()`
            This function is called by the constructor by default and performs the main task of forming the pages
        
          * `page()`
            Input parameters- `page_number` and returns the total number of pages generated
        
        
        ### Exceptions
        
          * `EmptyPageException`
            This Exception is raised when the `objects_per_page` value passed is 0
        
          * `EmptyQuerysetException`
            This Exception is raised when the total number of objects in the `query_set` is 0
