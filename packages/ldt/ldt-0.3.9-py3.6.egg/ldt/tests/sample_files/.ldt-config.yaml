# EXTRA RESOURCES:

# LDT expects to find the resources listed under the language_resources
# and corpus_resources in the specified path_to_resources. You can download
# the whole ldt_data folder here:
# https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZnkSn7ZUdfgWrtnfiyuXhjg9I0es0iPQRWy
# Unpack it to the location of your choosing and specify that location in
# the config file as path_to_resources.

# Extra language-specific resources.

  en:
    names: names.vocab
    numbers: numbers.vocab
    associations: associations.json

# If corpus data is available, specify the folder name. Otherwise, set to None.
