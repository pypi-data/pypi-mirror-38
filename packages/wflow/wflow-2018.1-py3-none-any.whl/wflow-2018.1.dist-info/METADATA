WFLOW
=====

wflow consists of a set of python programs that can be run on the command line 
and perform hydrological simulations. The models are based on the PCRaster 
python framework. In wflow this framework is extended (the wf_DynamicFramework) 
so that models build using the framework can be controlled using the API. 
Links to BMI, OpenMI and OpenDAP have been made.

A link to the latest version can always be found at https://github.com/openstreams/wflow

Obtaining wflow
===============

Go to https://github.com/openstreams/wflow. There you can download the source or a release. Also make sure
you get the required third party models first (see below). The documentation can be found at
http://wflow.readthedocs.org

Which version to use
====================
The master branch can change rapidly (and break functionality without warning) so please use one of the releases if possible. If you want to adjust things in the model(s) we assume you should be comfortable using the master branch.


Binaries for windows
====================
For windows binaries check the releases (https://github.com/openstreams/wflow/releases). These can be used 
if you do not have a python installation. However, it is recommended to install wflow as a python package (see below).
There is absolutely no guarantee the executables will work on your computer.

Install as a python package (windows quick install instructions)
================================================================

*Installing Anaconda (scientific python distribution)*

Download Anaconda for python 3, 64 bit from https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
We will assume that this python is available in the path, such that ``python``,
``pip``, and ``conda`` are available from the command line.

Note that there is no hard requirement for Anaconda Python, but often it makes installation
of required dependecies easier using ``conda``.

Once Anaconda is installed open a command window and install netCDF4, gdal and pyproj using the following command:

+ conda install netCDF4 gdal pyproj

*Installing pcraster*

+ Download pcraster from http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/ website (version 4.2)
+ Follow the installation instructions at http://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/quick-start-guide/

*Installing wflow itself*

Clone with git or download the latest zip with the source code of wflow. Go to the ``wflow-py`` directory and run:

+ ``pip install -e .``

This will create a link.

To check it the install is successful, go to the examples directory and run the following command:

+ ``python -m wflow.wflow_sbm -C wflow_rhine_sbm -R testing``

This should run without errors
