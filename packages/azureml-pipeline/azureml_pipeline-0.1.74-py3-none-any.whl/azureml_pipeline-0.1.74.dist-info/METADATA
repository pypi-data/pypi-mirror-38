Machine learning (ML) pipelines are used by data scientists to build, optimize, and manage their machine learning workflows. A typical pipeline involves a sequence of steps that cover the following areas:

 * Data preparation, such as normalizations and transformations
 * Model training, such as hyper parameter tuning and validation
 * Model deployment and evaluation

The Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python can be used to create ML pipelines as well as to submit and track individual pipeline runs.
