Description: # matlab_connection
        
        ### this package is designed to streamline reading from and writing data to MATLAB from python
        
        ### _Purpose_:<br>
        The matlab.engine library from Mathworks is impressive in that it allows python to connect to a MATLAB session, but can become a little long winded when interacting with numpy and calling functions.
        <br><br>
        The **matlab_connection** module contains a class that allows get and put variables, as well as call functions and run m-files in a straightforward, extensible manner.
        
        ### _Features_:<br>
        - get matlab variables into python
        - put python variables into MATLAB
        - run an script (not as a function) from python
        - call a MATLAB function from python
