# E^2 d^2Phi / dE dOmega (MeV cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) data from EGRET, for the search
# region 20 < |b| < 60. See fig. 1 of arXiv:1309.4091.
# Columns are: central flux, upper error bar, lower error bar.
# Note that the errors are the y coordinates of the error bars, not their relative
# distance from the central flux.
