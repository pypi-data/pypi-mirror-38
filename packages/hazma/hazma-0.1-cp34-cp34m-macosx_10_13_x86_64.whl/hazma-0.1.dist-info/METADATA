## Installation

`hazma` is currently still in development. If you would like to try it anyways, you can install it using the command:

    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ hazma

Alternatively, you can download `hazma` directly from github, navigate to the package directory using the command line and run

    pip install .

or

    python setup.py install

Since `hazma` utilizes C to rapidly compute gamma ray and electron/positron spectra, you will need to have the cython package installed.
