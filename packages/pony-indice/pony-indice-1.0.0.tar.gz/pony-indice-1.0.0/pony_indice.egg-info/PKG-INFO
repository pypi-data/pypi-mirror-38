        Pony Indice
        ===========
        
        Pony Indice is a Django re-usable app to create a simple search engine for your
        project.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Install it as usual (pip coming): ::
        
            pip install pony-indice
            
        Add the app in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``: ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
               ...
               'pony_indice',
               ...
            )
            
        And launch the migration to create the table: ::
        
            ./manage.py migrate
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The usage is quite simple: ::
        
            from pony_indice import registry as indice_registry
        
            @indice_registry.register()
            class YourModel(models.Models):
               rank = models.IntegerField()
        
        Now your model is tagged as "tracked" and the following behaviors are added:
        
        - On ``post_save`` signals a ``Link`` will be created/updated in database
        - On ``post_delete`` the ``Link`` will be mark as "removed"
        
        (Update aren't taken in account and may lead to broken URLs)
        
        Basicaly this app is based on the other decorated models, but you can easily
        import ``pony_indice.models.Link`` and add the link which you want, especialy
        external ones.
        
        Tools
        =====
        
        QuerySet
        --------
        
        The ``Link``'s queryset has the method ``filter_q`` method, which is a simple
        filter looking if fields ``display`` or ``description`` contain a string.
        Useful to create easily any search tool.
        
        Admin
        -----
        
        Of course the admin interface is already configured.
        
        REST Framework
        --------------
        
        ``pony_indice.contrib.rest_framework.serializers.LinkSerializer`` and
        ``pony_indice.contrib.rest_framework.viewsets.LinkViewsets`` are here to play
        quickly with Django REST Framework.
