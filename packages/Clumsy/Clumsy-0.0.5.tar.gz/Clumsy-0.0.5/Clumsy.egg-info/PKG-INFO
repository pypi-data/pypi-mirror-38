        # Clumsy
        Clumsy (originally cml_lib) is a collection of various scripts used in the computational memory lab's python analysis.
        
        What is Clumsy?
        -------------
        
        more details about it here blah blah blah:
        
        ```python
        
        from Clumsy.signal import rolling_window
        from typing import Iterator
        
        def fib(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
            a, b = 0, 1
            while a < n:
                yield a
                a, b = b, a + b
        ```
        See the documentation for more examples.
