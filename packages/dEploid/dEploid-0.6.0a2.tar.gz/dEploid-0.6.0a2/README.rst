`dEploid` is designed for deconvoluting mixed genomes with unknown proportions.
Traditional ‘phasing’ programs are limited to diploid organisms.
Our method modifies Li and Stephen’s algorithm with Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) approaches, and builds a generic framework that allows haloptype
searches in a multiple infection setting.
