Description
-----------
mpiFFT4py performs FFTs in parallel in Python. It is developed to be able to do FFTs in parallel on a three-dimensional computational box (a structured grid), but there are also routines for doing the FFTs on a 2D mesh. It implements both the *slab* and the *pencil* decompositions.

Installation
------------
mpiFFT4py requires *numpy* for basic array oparations, [*pyfftw*](https://github.com/pyfftw/pyFFTW) for efficient FFTs and [*mpi4py*](https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py) for MPI communications. However, if *pyfftw* is not found, then the slower *numpy.fft* is used instead. [*cython*](http://cython.org) is used to optimize a few routines. Install using regular python distutils::

    python setup.py install --prefix="Path on the PYTHONPATH"
  
To install in place do::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    
To install using Anaconda, you may either compile it yourselves using (from the main directory)::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda build conf/conda
    conda install mpiFFT4py --use-local
    
or use precompiled binaries in the[*conda-forge*](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mpifft4py) or the [*spectralDNS*](https://anaconda.org/spectralDNS/mpifft4py) channel on Anaconda cloud::

    conda install -c conda-forge mpifft4py

or::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install -c spectralDNS mpifft4py

There are binaries compiled for both OSX and linux, and several versions of Python. Note that the spectralDNS channel contains bleeding-edge versions of the Software, whereas conda-forge is more stable.
