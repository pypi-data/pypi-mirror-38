Description: Turning your configurations into actions - Declaring constructive configuration
        ===============================================================================
        
        Using a strong configuration backend, such as `pyhocon <https://pypi.org/project/pyhocon/>`__,
        relieves you from dealing with configuration sources, however, as a developer, you're still left
        with the task of turning these sources into action. This may involve further processing of specified
        values, checking for constraints, define exceptions or generally getting things in the right place.
        This package helps you doing so.
        
        My main motivation for creating this package was dealing with physical quantities.
        As a developer you adhere to a specific set of units that are used throughout your application,
        but for a user it might be just convenient to specify these values in different units.
        Say your program uses the SI unit system for its internal calculations and therefore you declare
        the length of some object in units of meter. But your users might specify objects of various
        magnitudes and therefore, for the sake of convenience, use different units such as centimeter or
        millimeter. Having a mechanism that automatically converts the specified values such that they meet
        the declaration is one of the many features of this package.
        
        `This package <https://dominik1123.gitbook.io/hanna>`__ separates the configuration process into
        two stages: declaration and specification.
        Declaration is performed by the developer while specification is done by the user.
        This package focuses on the declaration part and also builds a bridge between the two worlds by
        making sure that the specified values arrive exactly where you want them to be.
