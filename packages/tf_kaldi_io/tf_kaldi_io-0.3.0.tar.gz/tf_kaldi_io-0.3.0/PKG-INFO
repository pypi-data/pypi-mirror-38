Description: 
        A python package: provide a custom tensorflow dataset for kaldi io
        
        Python is its wrapper, C++ is its backend implemention. It depends on two things:
        
        Through [kaldi-io lib](https://github.com/open-speech/kaldi-io.git), it is able to:
        - direct read from kaldi rspecifier(scp, ark, in text or binary, just as [kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi))
        - support multiple feature transforms:
          - delta
          - cmvn
          - splice
          - sampling
        - compute fast: kaldi Matrix|Vector with blas math lib is used
        
        Through [tensorflow dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets), it is able to:
        - shuffling
        - batching at frame or utt level
        - bucketing with input sequence lengths
        - and all other tensorflow native dataset manipulations and features (parellel, prefetch, ..)
