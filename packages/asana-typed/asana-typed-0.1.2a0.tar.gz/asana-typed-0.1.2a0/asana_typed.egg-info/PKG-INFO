Description: Typed Asana API
        ===============
        
        Type Python Objects to complement
        `python-asana <https://github.com/Asana/python-asana>`__
        
        Inspiration
        -----------
        
        In a age of IDEs with code completion, I found python-asana lacking in
        their implementation of data structures regarding the api. This module
        is a WIP and does not implement all known objects as of yet.
        
        | Implemented API Objects:
        | - [ ] Attachments
        | - [ ] Custom Field Settings
        | - [ ] Custom Fields
        | - [ ] Event
        | - [ ] Organization Export
        | - [ ] Project Membership
        | - [x] Project Statue
        | - [x] Project
        | - [ ] Section
        | - [ ] Story
        | - [x] Tag
        | - [x] Task
        | - [ ] Teams
        | - [x] User
        | - [ ] Webhook
        | - [x] WorkSpace
        
        Acknowledgements
        ----------------
        
        Thanks to the creators over at `quicktype <https://app.quicktype.io/>`__
        I was able to save some time from having to type for each object or make
        a custom generator that uses Asana’s API Meta Data. Their API Meta Data
        doesn’t cover all types for list, hence why i went this route.
