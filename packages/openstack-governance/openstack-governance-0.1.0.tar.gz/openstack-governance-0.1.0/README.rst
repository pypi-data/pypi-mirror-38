This repository contains OpenStack Technical Committee reference documents
and tracks official resolutions voted by the committee.

Directory structure:

    reference/
        Reference documents which need to be revised over time.
        Some motions will just directly result in reference doc changes.
    resolutions/
        When the motion does not result in a change in a reference doc, it
        can be expressed as a resolution.
        Those must be named YYYYMMDD-short-name with YYYYMMDD being the
        proposal date in order to allow basic sorting.
    goals/
        Documentation for OpenStack community-wide goals, organized by
        release cycle. These pages will be updated with project status
        info over time, and if goals are revised.
