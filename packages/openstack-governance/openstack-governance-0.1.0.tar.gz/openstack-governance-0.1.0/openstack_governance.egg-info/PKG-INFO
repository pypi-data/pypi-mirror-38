                Reference documents which need to be revised over time.
                Some motions will just directly result in reference doc changes.
            resolutions/
                When the motion does not result in a change in a reference doc, it
                can be expressed as a resolution.
                Those must be named YYYYMMDD-short-name with YYYYMMDD being the
                proposal date in order to allow basic sorting.
