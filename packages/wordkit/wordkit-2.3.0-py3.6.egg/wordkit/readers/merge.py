def merge(from_corpus, to_corpus, merge_fields, transfer_fields):
    """
    Augment a corpus by data from another corpus by transfering fields.

    merge joins corpora together by augmenting the information from one corpus,
    the to_corpus, by information from another corpus, the from_corpus.

    For example, given a corpus of orthography - phonology
    combinations and a corpus of frequency norms, merge can be used
    to add frequency norms to the orthography - phonology combinations.

    Merging requires that there is overlap between the fields of the
    corpora. The parameter merge_fields specifies by which fields the corpora
    should be merged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    from_corpus : list of dictionaries
        A list of dictionaries. This corpus will be used to augment
        the information in the to_corpus.

    to_corpus : list of dictionaries
        A list of dictionaries. This corpus will be augmented with the
        information from the from_corpus.

    merge_fields : tuple
        The fields to use in determining equivalence between two words in the
        corpora. For example, if union_fields = ("orthography",), only the
        orthography field is used to compare words. If union_fields =
        ("orthography", "phonology"), both the information in "orthography" and
        "phonology" needs to be equivalent.

    transfer_fields : tuple
        The fields to transfer from the from_corpus to the to_corpus.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from wordkit.readers import Celex, Subtlex, merge
    >>> s = Subtlex("path")
    >>> c = Celex("path")
    >>> words_s = s.transform()
    >>> words_c = c.transform()
    >>> new = merge(words_s, words_c, ("orthography",), ("frequency",))
