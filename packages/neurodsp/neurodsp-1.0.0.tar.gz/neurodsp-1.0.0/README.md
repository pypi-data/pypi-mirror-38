A package of tools to process, analyze, and simulate neural recordings as individual voltage time series, with specific focus on time and frequency domain analyses. The primary purpose of this library is to serve as the shared codebase of common analyses for the [Voytek Lab](http://voyteklab.com/), but we welcome anyone's use and contributions.

## Python version support
This package has been tested on python 3.5, and 3.6 with the latest [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution. Support for python 2 and earlier versions of python 3 is not guaranteed.

## Install

To install the latest release of neurodsp, you can install from pip:

`$ pip install neurodsp`

To get the development version (updates that are not yet published to pip), you can clone this repo.

`$ git clone https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp.git`

To install this cloned copy of neurodsp, move into the directory you just cloned, and run:

`$ pip install .`
