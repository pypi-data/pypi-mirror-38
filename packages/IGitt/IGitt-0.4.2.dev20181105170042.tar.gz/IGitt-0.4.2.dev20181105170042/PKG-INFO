        IGitt
        =====
        
        This is a simple library that allows you to access various git hosting
        services like GitHub, GitLab and so on via one unified python interface.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Make sure you have Python 3 installed. IGitt will not work with Python 2.
        
        Simply install it with::
        
            pip install IGitt
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        All classes follow the APIs given in `IGitt.Interfaces`. Here's an example on
        how to set labels on a GitHub issue::
        
            from IGitt.GitHub.GitHubIssue import GitHubToken, GitHubIssue
            issue = GitHubIssue(GitHubToken("YOUR TOKEN"), "ORG/REPO", NUMBER)
        
            issue.labels = {"type/bug", "area/core"}

        What About the Name?
        --------------------
        
        This is an **I**\ nterface for **Git** hosting services. Igitt itself
        comes from the german language and can be defined "an exclamation of
        disgust in regards to an offensive odor, taste, sight, or thought".
