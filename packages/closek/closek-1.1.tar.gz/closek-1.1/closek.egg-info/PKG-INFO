Description: Close-k Classifier
        ==================
        
        This repository contains code accompanying
        > [Minimizing Close-k Aggregate Loss Improves Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00521)

        We provide a Python 3 implementation using the
        [scikit-learn API](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects),
        and provide code to reproduce the figures and tables from the paper.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Our package is available on [PyPy](https://pypi.org/project/closek/), and can be installed using
        > pip install -i https://pypi.org/project/ closek
        
        You can also install this package by cloning the [Github repository](github.com/bryan-he/closek), and running
        > pip install closek
        
        If you want directly use the implementation in your package, you can also copy
        [closek/closek.py](github.com/bryan-he/closekclosek/closek.py) into your code.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        An example of how to use our package is shown in [test.py](github.com/bryan-he/closek/test.py).
        
        Generating Results from Paper
        -----------------------------
        
        The code used for the paper is in [experiments](github.com/bryan-he/closek/experiments). See the README
        there for more details.
