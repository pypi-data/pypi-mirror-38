        bye-bye-shopify
        ===============
        
        If your Shopify store isn't doing too well, it's time to close it, but Shopify doesn't
        provide an easy way to extract all your product catalogue. This Python utility allows
        you to do that. I wrote it for and tested it only on my mom's candle store.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Extract products and product variations to a JSON file, one per product
        * Extract product images to a local directory
        * Extract custom collections
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install bye-bye-shopify
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        In Shopify Admin, under *Apps* / *Manage private apps* (link at the very bottom
        of the page), create a new private app. The name of the app doesn't matter.
        Set the following environment variables by copying the values of *API key* and *Password*
        displayed on the page:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            export BYE_BYE_API_KEY="..."
            export BYE_BYE_API_PASSWORD="..."
        
        You will also need to set the hostname of your shop which is probably something
        like ``yourshopname.myshopify.com``:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            export BYE_BYE_API_HOSTNAME="yourshopname.myshopify.com"
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            bye-bye-shopify --help
        
            bye-bye-shopify download_all
        
            ls -al data/products/
            ls -al data/custom_collections/
