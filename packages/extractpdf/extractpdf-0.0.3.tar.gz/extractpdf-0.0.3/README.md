# extractpdf
A python package focused on extracting content out of PDF files.

There seems to be [many options out there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34837707/how-to-extract-text-from-a-pdf-file), but no single solution that is easy to install, even on Windows, and focus specifically on PDF files. So we have created this extractpdf package.

It is based on [Textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract) structure, but focuses on PDF only, and adds also other tools to the pipline, such as [PyPDF2](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/) and [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/).


# Usage:
To use this package, install it from pypi using:
```
pip install extractpdf
```

Then use it like so:
```python
import extractpdf as epdf

# local file
content = epdf.process('my_file.pdf')
# url:
content = epdf.process('http://www.example.com/some_file.pdf')
```

# Advanced Usage:
To control more features, one can use the PDFExtractor itself:
```python
from extractpdf import PDFExtractor
epdf = PDFExtractor()
content = epdf.get_content('http://www.example.com/some_file.pdf', keep_download=True)
f = epdf.filename # f = some_file.pdf
epdf.delete_file()
```
