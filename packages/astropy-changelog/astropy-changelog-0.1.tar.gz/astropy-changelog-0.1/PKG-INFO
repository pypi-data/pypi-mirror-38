        This package contains a parser for the Astropy changelog format. Example usage:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            In [1]: from astropy_changelog import load
        
            In [2]: changes = load('CHANGES.rst')
        
            In [3]: changes.versions
            Out[3]:
            ['0.1',
             '0.2',
             '0.2.1',
             '0.2.2',
             '0.2.3',
             ...]
        
            In [4]: changes.issues
            Out[4]:
            [256,
             272,
             291,
             293,
             296,
             ...]
        
            In [5]: changes.versions_for_issue(4242)
            Out[5]: ['1.2']
        
            In [6]: changes.issues_for_version('2.0.7')
            Out[6]: [7411, 7248, 7402, 7422, 7469, 7486, 7453, 7493, 7510, 7493]
        
        Format specification
        --------------------
        
        The current format uses reStructuredText. Changelog entries should be given as
        bullet point items inside sections for each version. These sections should have
        a title with the following syntax::
        
            version (release date)
        
        The release date can be ``unreleased`` if the version is not released yet.
        
        The version sections can optionally include sub-sections in which the bullet
        items are organized, and the file can also optionally include an overall title.
