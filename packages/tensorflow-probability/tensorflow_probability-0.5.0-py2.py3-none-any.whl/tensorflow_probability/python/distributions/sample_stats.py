    name="auto_correlation"):
  """Auto correlation along one axis.

  Given a `1-D` wide sense stationary (WSS) sequence `X`, the auto correlation
  `RXX` may be defined as  (with `E` expectation and `Conj` complex conjugate)

  ```
  RXX[m] := E{ W[m] Conj(W[0]) } = E{ W[0] Conj(W[-m]) },
  W[n]   := (X[n] - MU) / S,
  MU     := E{ X[0] },
  S**2   := E{ (X[0] - MU) Conj(X[0] - MU) }.
  ```

  This function takes the viewpoint that `x` is (along one axis) a finite
  sub-sequence of a realization of (WSS) `X`, and then uses `x` to produce an
  estimate of `RXX[m]` as follows:

  After extending `x` from length `L` to `inf` by zero padding, the auto
  correlation estimate `rxx[m]` is computed for `m = 0, 1, ..., max_lags` as

  ```
  rxx[m] := (L - m)**-1 sum_n w[n + m] Conj(w[n]),
  w[n]   := (x[n] - mu) / s,
  mu     := L**-1 sum_n x[n],
  s**2   := L**-1 sum_n (x[n] - mu) Conj(x[n] - mu)
  ```

  The error in this estimate is proportional to `1 / sqrt(len(x) - m)`, so users
  often set `max_lags` small enough so that the entire output is meaningful.

  Note that since `mu` is an imperfect estimate of `E{ X[0] }`, and we divide by
  `len(x) - m` rather than `len(x) - m - 1`, our estimate of auto correlation
  contains a slight bias, which goes to zero as `len(x) - m --> infinity`.

  Args:
    x:  `float32` or `complex64` `Tensor`.
    axis:  Python `int`. The axis number along which to compute correlation.
      Other dimensions index different batch members.
    max_lags:  Positive `int` tensor.  The maximum value of `m` to consider
      (in equation above).  If `max_lags >= x.shape[axis]`, we effectively
      re-set `max_lags` to `x.shape[axis] - 1`.
    center:  Python `bool`.  If `False`, do not subtract the mean estimate `mu`
      from `x[n]` when forming `w[n]`.
    normalize:  Python `bool`.  If `False`, do not divide by the variance
      estimate `s**2` when forming `w[n]`.
    name:  `String` name to prepend to created ops.

  Returns:
    `rxx`: `Tensor` of same `dtype` as `x`.  `rxx.shape[i] = x.shape[i]` for
      `i != axis`, and `rxx.shape[axis] = max_lags + 1`.

  Raises:
    TypeError:  If `x` is not a supported type.

  The values and distances of the two nearest neighbors as well as the
  `interpolation` parameter will determine the percentile if the normalized
  ranking does not match the location of `q` exactly.

  This function is the same as the median if `q = 50`, the same as the minimum
  if `q = 0` and the same as the maximum if `q = 100`.

  Multiple percentiles can be computed at once by using `1-D` vector `q`.
  Dimension zero of the returned `Tensor` will index the different percentiles.

  # Get 30th percentile with default ('nearest') interpolation.
  x = [1., 2., 3., 4.]

  ==> 2.0

  # Get 30th and 70th percentiles with 'lower' interpolation
  x = [1., 2., 3., 4.]
  percentile(x, q=[30., 70.], interpolation='lower')

      percentile.  If `None` (the default), treat every dimension as a sample
      dimension, returning a scalar.
    interpolation : {"lower", "higher", "nearest"}.  Default: "nearest"
      This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
