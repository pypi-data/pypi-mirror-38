PycoQC-2 is a Pure Python 3 package for Jupyter Notebook, computing metrics and
generating simple QC plots from the sequencing summary report generated by
Oxford Nanopore technologies Albacore basecaller

Description: 
        As opposed to more exhaustive QC programs for nanopore data, pycoQC is very fast as it relies entirely on the sequencing_summary.txt file generated by ONT Albacore basecaller.
        Consequently, pycoQC will only provide metrics at read level metrics (and not at base level).
        The package supports 1D and 1D2 runs analysed with Albacore.
        
        PycoQC requires the following fields in the sequencing.summary.txt file:
        
        1D run => read_id, run_id, channel, start_time, sequence_length_template, mean_qscore_template
        
        1D2 run => read_id, run_id, channel, start_time, sequence_length_2d, mean_qscore_2d
        
        In addition it will try to get the following optional fields if they are available:
        
        calibration_strand_genome_template, barcode_arrangement
