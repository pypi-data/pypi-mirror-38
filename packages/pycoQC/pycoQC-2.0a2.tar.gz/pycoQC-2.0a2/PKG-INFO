Description: 
        pycoQC is a very simple quality control package for Nanopore data written in pure **python3**, meant
        to be used directly in a **jupyter notebook** 4.0.0 +. As opposed to more exhaustive QC programs for nanopore
        data, pycoQC is very fast as it relies entirely on the *sequencing_summary.txt* file generated by ONT Albacore
        Sequencing Pipeline Software 1.2.1+, during base calling. Consequently, pycoQC will only provide metrics at read level
        metrics (and not at base level). The package supports 1D and 1D2 runs analysed with Albacore.
        
        PycoQC requires the following fields in the sequencing.summary.txt file:
        
        * 1D run => **read_id**, **run_id**, **channel**, **start_time**, **sequence_length_template**, **mean_qscore_template**
        * 1D2 run =>**read_id**, **run_id**, **channel**, **start_time**, **sequence_length_2d**, **mean_qscore_2d**
        
        In addition it will try to get the following optional fields if they are available:
        
        * **num_events**, **calibration_strand_genome_template**, **passes_filtering**
