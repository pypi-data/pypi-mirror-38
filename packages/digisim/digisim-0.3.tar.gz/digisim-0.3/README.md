# Welcome to DigiSim!

This is a minimalistic library for scalable simulation of complex combinational digital logic in python. We have included various commonly used methods and techniques for dealing with digital logic and boolean algebra.


## Prerequisites

You need to install `tkinter` first to work with logic gates functionality of the library.
Install `tkinter` by using command below- 

* `sudo apt-get install python-tk` - For ubuntu versions 16x and below.
* `sudo apt install python-tk` - For ubuntu versions 18x and above.

For windows, install tkinter by using this link-- [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)



## Installation

Currently we only have support for python 2.x. Use one of the following commands to install the library.

* `pip install digisim` - Make sure your default python interpreter is python 2.x.
* `python -m pip install digisim` - Can be used on windows.
* `sudo pip install digisim` - Try giving sudo access.
* `pip2 install digisim` - Try this in case above commands return error.
