Description: 
        # Welcome to DigiSim!
        
        This is a minimalistic library for scalable simulation of complex combinational digital logic in python. We have included various commonly used methods and techniques for dealing with digital logic and boolean algebra.
        
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        You need to install `tkinter` first to work with logic gates functionality of the library.
        Install `tkinter` by using command below- 
        
        * `sudo apt-get install python-tk` - For ubuntu versions 16x and below.
        * `sudo apt install python-tk` - For ubuntu versions 18x and above.
        
        For windows, install tkinter by using this link-- [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Currently we only have support for python 2.x. Use one of the following commands to install the library.
        
        * `pip install digisim` - Make sure your default python interpreter is python 2.x.
        * `python -m pip install digisim` - Can be used on windows.
        * `sudo pip install digisim` - Try giving sudo access.
        * `pip2 install digisim` - Try this in case above commands return error.
