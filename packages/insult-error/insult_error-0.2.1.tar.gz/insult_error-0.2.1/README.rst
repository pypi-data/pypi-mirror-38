Intentionally Insulting Exceptions for Python
=============================================

This package provides a set of insulting exceptions you can use to make
your future self laugh, bother your collaborators, or both.

The core feature is the ``InsultError`` exception class, which behaves
just like a normal exception with a few differences: 1. The raised error
is a randomly-selected subclass with a silly, insulting name 2. If no
message is provided, the error will use a random insulting message 3. A
special keyword argument ``rating`` provides some control over how
offensive you want the error and message to be (1 being tamest and 10
being meanest)

Please contribute! This package will be much more fun if not limited to
the measily initial set of options. Obviously, racist, sexist, or other
bullshit jokes are not welcome.

Example Usage
-------------

.. code:: python

    from insult_error import InsultError

    # raise a random insult with a random message (defaults to rating=5)
    raise InsultError
    # >>> NotThisAgain: Don't believe everything you think.

    # raise a random insult with a user-specified message
    raise InsultError('This is my message')
    # >>> NotThisAgain: This is my message

    # raise a random insult with <= 2 rating
    raise InsultError(rating=2)
    # >>> ForGodsSake: I donâ€™t have the time or the crayons to explain this to you.

    # raise a random insult with <= 6 rating
    raise InsultError(rating=6)
    # >>> FuckYouBuddy: I envy people who have never met you.

    # handle InsultError exceptions (just like normal, non-insulting errors)
    try:
        raise InsultError
    except InsultError
        print('Better luck next time!')
    # >>> Better luck next time!
