        ![build](https://travis-ci.org/CatEars/goto.svg?branch=master)
        
        A Python command line tool for navigating your computer!
        
        ## Key Features
        
        * Add commonly visited places, like `code/my_project` and teleport to it from anywhere!
        * Did you say you want auto-completion with that? Of course there is auto-completion!
        * Works with both zsh and bash!
        * What if you want to call `my_project` "secret_project" instead? This is entirely possible!
        * Do you want different auto completion at different times? We got profiles for that!
