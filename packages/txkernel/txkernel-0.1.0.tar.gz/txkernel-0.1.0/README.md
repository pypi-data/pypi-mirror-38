# TXKernel
*TXKernel* is a base kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) powered by [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). TXKernel development really revolves around [ILua](https://github.com/guysv/ilua), at least for it's early stages. If your kernel is to be written in Python, I'd recommend checking out [Jupyter's repositories](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/) as they contain much more mature base classes
