        ---------------------------
        
        1. Download rpm from official site:
           https://github.com/vstconsulting/polemarch/releases
        
        2. Install it with command
        
           .. sourcecode:: bash
        
              sudo yum localinstall polemarch-X.X.X-0.x86_64.rpm.
        
        3. Run services with commands
        
           .. sourcecode:: bash
        
              sudo service polemarchweb start
              sudo service polemarchworker start
        
        That's it. Polemarch web panel on 8080 port. Default administrative account is
        admin/admin.
        
        If you have any problems with `.deb` package, you can install it from PyPi:
        https://polemarch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#install-from-pypi
        
        Note: If you using authentication by password at some of your machines
        managed by Polemarch, you also must install ``sshpass`` package because it
        required for ansible to autheticate via ssh by password. It available in
        EPEL for Red Hat/CentOS. Also you can use specify ``connection`` command line
        argument during playbook run as ``paramiko``. When ansible uses paramiko to
        make ssh connection, ``sshpass`` not necessary.

        application.
        
        Default installation is suitable for most simple and common cases, but
        Polemarch is highly configurable system. If you need something more advanced
        (scalability, dedicated DB, custom cache, logging or directories) you can
        always configure Polemarch like said in documentation at
        http://polemarch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
