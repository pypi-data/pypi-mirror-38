Description: 
        neuro_tagger
        ============
        
        Text tagger based on recurrent neural network. It can be used as NER,
        dependency parser, morphoanalyzer etc.
        
        The goal of this project is creation of a simple Python package with
        the sklearn-like interface for solution of different tasks of text
        tagging (named entity recognition, dependency parsing, etc) in case
        number of labeled texts is very small (not greater than several
        thousands). Special word embeddings named as ELMo (**E**mbeddings from
        **L**anguage **Mo**dels) ensure this possibility, because these
        embeddings are contextual and they allow to design more simple and
        separable feature space for words in texts.
        
        ELMo embeddings are used as features of words in text, and different
        variants of neural network architecture (BiLSTM, hybrid BiLSTM-CRF or
        pure CRF) can be used as final classifier (tagger). I recommend to
        use a special *TensorFlow Hub ELMo* for English NLP tasks and a
        *DeepPavlov ELMo* for for same tasks in Russian.
