Description: # Networkqit package
        
        The spectral entropy framework
        ------------------------------
        
        An information theoretic approach inspired by quantum statistical mechanics was recently proposed as a means 
        to optimize network models and to assess their likelihood against synthetic and real-world networks.
        Importantly, this method does not rely on specific topological features or network descriptors, 
        but leverages entropy-based measures of network distance.
        Entertaining the analogy with thermodynamics, **networkqit** provides a computational tool for the estimate of 
        spectral entropy and fitting of model parameters.
        These results enable the practical application of this novel and powerful framework to network model inference.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        The full documentation for this package under development and is currently being written, its current version is available at:
        
        https://networkqit.github.io/
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To use the **networkqit** package we suggest to use `virtualenv`.
        The **networkqit** package is pure Python, so it should work on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.
        Here we report instructions for usage in a standard Ubuntu linux installation.
        
        How to install on Linux
        -----------------------
        
        1. Open a terminal, install `pip` and `virtualenv` and clone this repository
        	
        	
            cd
        	sudo apt-get install python3-pip
        	sudo pip3 install virtualenv
        	virtualenv workspace
        	cd workspace
        	git clone https://bitbucket.org/carlonicolini/networkqit
        	
        2. You cloned the repository. Now start the virtualenv session.
        
        
        	source bin/activate
        
        3. If you are inside the `virtualenv` session, check that the Python version you are using is the one provided by `virtualenv`.
        
        
        	which python3
        
        4. Now install the networkqit package within the `virtualenv` environment.
        
        
        	cd networkqit
        	python3 setup.py sdist
        
        Now install the created Python package, that should come with all its dependencies `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `pandas`, `numdifftools`, `bctpy`
        
        
        	cd ..
        	pip3 install networkqit/dist/networkqit-0.1.tar.gz
