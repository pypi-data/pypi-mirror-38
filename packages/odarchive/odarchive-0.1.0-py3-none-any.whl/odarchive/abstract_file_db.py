"""This is an database of files.

It is based on a list of entries.

It is centred on the file system.  Each file has a separate entry  It can be enhanced.
This is a temporary structure and although can be preserved by pickle is not intended to have a long duration.
So it does not need versioning.

Things it doesn't do:

- Segment the database.  See hash_db
