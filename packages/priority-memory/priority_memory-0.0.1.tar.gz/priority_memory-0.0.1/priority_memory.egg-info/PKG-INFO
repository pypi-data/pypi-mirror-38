Description: # Priority Memory
        
        Fast priority experience replay buffer. 
        
        The implementation is based on sum tree, or segmentation tree.
        
        - Set the priority of each sample at anytime. 
        - When you do not know the priority of the sample, you can append 
          them to the buffer, and they will show up in the next sampling batch.
        - When the buffer is full, drop the samples with lowest priority.
        
        The time complexity for sampling a batch with batch size m 
        from a dataset with n samples is O(mlogn), for setting priority 
        for the batch is O(mlogn).
        
        
        # Usage
        
        > pip install priority_memory
        
        ```python
        
        from priority_memory import FastPriorReplayBuffer
        
        buffer = FastPriorReplayBuffer(8000)
        buffer.append(features=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1], prior=1)
        buffer.append(features=[0.2, 0.2, 0.2], prior=2)
        buffer.append(features=[0.3, 0.3, 0.3], prior=3)
        buffer.append(features=[0.4, 0.4, 0.4], prior=4)
        indexes, data, weights = buffer.sample_with_weights(batch_size=2)
        
        mae = [10, 20]
        buffer.set_weights(indexes, mae)
        
        ```
