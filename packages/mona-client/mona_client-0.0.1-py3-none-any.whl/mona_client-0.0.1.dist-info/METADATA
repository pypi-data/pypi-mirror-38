# Python Client

## Using Mona's wrapper for the "requests" package

instead of importing "requests", import the requests object from mona_requests:
`from mona_requests import requests`

After that, use requests as usual. The only difference in behavior is that any
request or session will always have a header "mona_id" added to it, with the
current context's complete id.

## Concurrency

Mona saves the ARC's id on a special variable, which is local to the thread and
to greenlets. This means that if you start a new thread/greenlet, by default the
new thread will have an empty context.

This is usually the preffered behavior, as a new thread usually means a new
received request (on servers) or a completely new run of an algorithm.

If by any chance you'd like to continue with the same context on a new thread,
just use the child class MonaThread under mona_thread.py. This class takes
care of transferring the full context id to the newly started thread.

## Using Mona's GCP pubusb support

We provide support for transferring Mona context data via pubsub using our
class MonaPublisherClient (child of PublisherClient). This class extends the
functionaliy of the publish() method, by adding the current context id via the
message attributes.

On the other side, if you subscribe to a pubsub topic and wish to have your mona
context change according to the publisher's context, just send any message to
our init_mona_from_pubsub_message(msg) method. That's it.

## Testing the client code

The client's tests are written using the pytest framework, so in order to run
the tests (assuming you have pytest installed on your environment), you just
need to type "pytest" to your shell.

The only caveat is in pubsub_test.py, which you need to use a pubsub emulator to
activate. Please refer to that file for explanations.
