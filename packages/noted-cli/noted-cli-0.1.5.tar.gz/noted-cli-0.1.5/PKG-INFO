        ## Contributing
        ### Setup development environment
        
        1. Clone repository
        2. Setup virtual env and install dependencies:
        
        ```
        cd noted-cli
        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        
        LOGLEVEL=DEBUG python3 noted
        ```
        
        ### Build for distribution
        Run `./pack-dist` in the base directory. Built file/files will be located in
        `dist/`
        
        
        ## Debugging
        You can enable the debug log by launching noted with the environment variable
        `LOGLEVEL` set to `DEBUG`.
        
        Example: `LOGLEVEL=DEBUG noted`
        
        By default, if `LOGFILE` environment variable is not specified, the logging
        data will be written to `noted.log` in the storage directory `$HOME/.noted`.
        
        The default log level is set to `WARNING`.
        
        ## TODO
        - Change encryption passphrase.
        - Delete tag entity when removing last use of tag from note.
        - Rename tags.
        - Delete tags.
        - Be able to store a search query.
        - Be able to initiate the TUI with arguments.
        - Tag auto complete when using tag object notation in search field.
        - Configure editor (xdg-open?).
        - Safer way of opening database/files to increase privacy/security.
        
        ## Considerations
        - Utilize GnuPG for encryption of database and files.
        - Break out CLI/TUI version to own project/s
        
        ## Known bugs/issues
        - Cannot edit note on macOS. Issue due to tmpfs removing file before we get
          the chance to read?
        - Log file gets created in cwd.
        - Saving an empty note causes SQLite exception.
        - Curses doesn't restore terminal after VIM has been opened in some cases (may
          be caused by some VIM plugin).
