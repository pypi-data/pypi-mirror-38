Signals
*******

Flatland can notify your code when events of interest occur during
flatland processing using "Blinker" signals.  These signals can be
used for advanced customization in your application or simply as a
means for tracing and logging flatland activity during development.

element_set = <blinker.base.NamedSignal object at 0x7f471ce81310; 'element_set'>

   Emitted after "set()" has been called on an element.

   Parameters:
      * **sender** – the element

      * **adapted** – boolean, True if the set() adapted
        successfully.

validator_validated = <blinker.base.NamedSignal object at 0x7f471ceb8210; 'validator_validated'>
