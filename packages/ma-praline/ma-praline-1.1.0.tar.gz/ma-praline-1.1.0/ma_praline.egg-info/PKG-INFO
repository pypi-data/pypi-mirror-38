Description: # Motif-Aware PRALINE (MA-PRALINE)
        
        A motif-aware multiple sequence alignment tool. An article accompanying this software has been published in PLOS Computational Biology [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006547).
        
        # Installing MA-PRALINE
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python 2.7 / Python 3.6 (earlier 3.x versions may also work, but have not been tested)
        * An installation of PRALINE (https://github.com/ibivu/PRALINE)
        
        ## Instructions
        
        You can install MA-PRALINE by cloning this repository and running (in a shell):
        
        `python setup.py install`
        
        MA-PRALINE is also available on PyPI. You can install it with the following command:
        
        `pip install ma-praline`
        
        # Extras
        
        There is an additional repository at https://github.com/ibivu/MA-PRALINE-extras containing
        auxiliary code that was used to perform various analyses while developing MA-PRALINE.
        Although no support is provided for this code, some people may find it useful to, e.g.
        reparameterise MA-PRALINE or to calculate motif statistics.
