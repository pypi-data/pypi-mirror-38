Description: ThreatBook\_API Resource Storage SDK for Python
        ===============================================
        
        1 INTRODUCTION
        --------------
        
        This release provides access to the corresponding functionality through
        both public API\_KEY and private API\_KEY.
        
        The public API\_KEY can access the file detection function of the cloud
        sandbox. You need to register for a ThreatBook online account and view
        your API Key through the Personal Center, which will be used for all
        your API operations without submitting via the web, uploading the
        file/URL for analysis and extracting the completed analysis. Report
        data. The ThreatBook Online Sandbox API is a free service available for
        free websites and programs. Please do not use the API for any commercial
        product or service, as an alternative to an anti-virus product, or for
        any project that may directly or indirectly damage the anti-virus
        industry.
        
        The private API\_KEY provides an easy way to invoke data from the Threat
        Analytics Platform database and its detection and analysis capabilities
        from any client. It includes the following functions: file digital
        signature identification, new registered domain query, email
        registration information query, domain analysis, IOC detection, IP
        analysis, IP reputation query, etc. As our business customer or partner,
        we will deliver your corresponding apikey by mail.
        
        2 INSTALLATION
        --------------
        
        | ``$ pip install threatbook_api``
        
        | Once you have successfully installed the package, you can use it by
        
        importing it. The following example shows how to get the current whois
        information for a domain:
        
        ::
        
            from threatbook_api.domain_analysis_query import DomainAnalysis
        
            # create an instance object
            test = DomainAnalysis('your private api_key')
        
            # Get the current whois information of the domain
            info = test.get_cur_whois('domain to be queried  ')
            print(info)
