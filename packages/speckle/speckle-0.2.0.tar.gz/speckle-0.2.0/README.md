## Disclaimer
This code is very WIP and as such should be used with extreme caution, on non-sensitive projects.
There is much to be tightened up, optimized, organized, etc. but the basic functionality is there.

## Description

PySpeckle is a light Python wrapper / interface for the Speckle framework. It can be used independently through Python scripts, or as a base for building various plug-ins, such as [SpeckleBlender](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleBlender). 

## Notes
SpeckleBlender is written and sort of maintained by [Tom Svilans](http://tomsvilans.com) ([Github](https://github.com/tsvilans)).
