Description: ===========
        mqtt-codec
        ===========
        
        A weapons grade MQTT packet encoder and decoder (codec).
        
        Status
        =======
        
        The `mqtt-codec` package is an MQTT packet encoder and decoder (codec).
        The library has high test coverage (~94%) and is known to perform well
        in distributed IoT networks with thousands of nodes.
        
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        The mqtt-codec package can be from `<pypi.org>`_ with
        `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install mqtt-codec
        
        Installations can also be performed from source in the traditional
        manner:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           python setup.py install
        
        
        Python Requirements
        ====================
        
        The ``mqtt-codec`` project has been tested on Linux against these
        environments:
        
        * Python 2.7
        * Python 3.4
        * Python 3.5
        * Python 3.6
        * Python 3.7
        
        Python versions Python 3.0 - 3.3 may work but are not tested as part of
        the project continuous integration infrastructure.
        
        
        Library Requirements
        =====================
        
        When running Python versions less than 3.4 the ``enum34`` package is
        required.  There are no other package requirements.
        
        
        Project Infrastructure
        =======================
        
        The project is coordinated through public infrastructure available at
        several places:
        
        * `Releases (pypi) <https://pypi.org/project/mqtt-codec>`_
        * `Documentation (readthedocs.io) <https://mqtt-codec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
        * `Bug Tracker (github) <https://github.com/kcallin/mqtt-codec/issues>`_
        * `Code Repository (github) <https://github.com/kcallin/mqtt-codec>`_
