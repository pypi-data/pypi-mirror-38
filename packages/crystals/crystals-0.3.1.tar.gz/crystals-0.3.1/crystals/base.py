    Base class for atomic structures. These structures can be made
    out of :class:`Atom` objects, or other AtomicStructure subclasses.

    The AtomicStructure class provides an abstraction over structure with and without
    substructure. Subclasses can be iterated over as an iterable of atoms. Order of iteration
    is not guaranteed.
    
    Hierarchical containership of AtomicStructures is implemented, as well as 
    containership of :class:`Atom` instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : iterable, optional
        Atoms not attached to a substructure.
    substructures : iterable, optional
        Atomic substructures. For example, different atom chains could form
        a secondary structure in a protein.
