Description: NeoCommand
        ==========
        
        `NeoCommand`:t: is an extension of `Intermake`:t: that provides manipulation of graph/network/tree data through the concept of Endpoints, through which Nodes, Edges, sub-graphs and arbitrary data are relayed.
        
        This library primarily supports the `Bio42`:t: application, which focuses on genomic data.
        
        The user is therefore directed to the `Bio42`:t: readme.
        
        Please see the source code documentation itself for specific `NeoCommand`:t: usage.
