        #### Platforms
        Linux, Macos, Windows
        
        #### Description
        * Assists with flow-based troubleshooting where there are at
          least 2 pcaps. See [Usage](https://pcapgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_usage.html) 
          for detailed use cases and options.
        * Create a horizontal bar graph to visualize when pcaps were taken.
        * Use set operations to find patterns among multiple packet
          captures in ways that Wireshark is not able to.
        * If an output format is not specified, the default behavior is to print to
          stdout and send a [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) graph to the
          screen (thus the name).
