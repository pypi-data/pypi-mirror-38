# noaareport

A library used to read the noaa's solar report. It uses pandas to store the data into a dataframe making it easy to manipulate.

## Installation

### Python package

```bash
pip install noaareport
```

### CLI tool

```bash
./install_cli ~/Path/To/Report/Files/
```

In your reports folder the folders for each year must be set as in noaa's website. E.g: 2014 -> 2014_events/. You can use the grabit.sh script to download all the files from 1996 to 2017.
