SPOOKIFY
Halloween name generator

George Watson, 2018
Available under an MIT licence (see LICENSE)

Spookifies all words of 3 or more characters.
To force a match for words shorter than 3 characters, append some dots or
something.

Dependencies:
- Standard:
    json
    os
    random
    regex
    string
    sys
- Third-party:
    jellyfish <https://pypi.org/project/jellyfish/>
        Available through pip (pip install jellyfish)
    pkg_resources

Provides the following functions:
    spookify(name, [list_type], [seed])*
        The main function
        Returns a punned-upon version of the string 'name', using the selected
        wordlist; by default, spooky Halloween substitutions are used
    best_substitution(word, possible_subs, [seed])*
        Performs the best substitution of a member of possible_subs into word
    score_substitution(word_part, possible_sub)
        Scores the desirability of replacing word_part with possible_sub
(Functions marked * include pseudo-random elements; a seed may be defined if
this is undesirable)

The above components are available for use in other code if imported correctly,
and should have no side effects.
However, Spookify is not at present packaged as a formal module and is provided
as-is without any guarantee of safety or fitness for purpose.
