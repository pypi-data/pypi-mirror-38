  additional links.

Version 0.3.5 focuses on refactoring the whole project. The API itself remains
largely the same as in previous versions, but underlyingly modules have been
split up. Essentially no new features are added (bugfixes aside) in this
version.

Changes:

- Refactored library and tests into smaller modules
- Broke compression distances (NCD) out into separate functions
- Adopted Black code style
- Added pyproject.toml to use Poetry for packaging (but will continue using
  setuptools and setup.py for the present)
- Minor bug fixes

distance measures, fingerprints, and even a few stemmers. Another focus was
