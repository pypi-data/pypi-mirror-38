        Chatter
        =====
        
        Chatter is a simple chat application based on Django Channels 2.0. 
        The goal of this app is to turn it into a package that can be easily
        inserted into Django web apps for developers to use. 
        
        Note: This component depends on Django Channels, so I recommend getting	
        familiar with and installing Channels's server as your dev server from
        https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
        
        
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Install django-channels from the installation site
        
        2. Add `chat` to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this (please make sure it's
        below your project's appname)::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'chat',
                ...
            ]
        
        3. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            path('chat/', include('chat.urls')),
        
        4. Add chat to your '<project_name>/routing.py' by adding the following lines::
        	from channels.auth import AuthMiddlewareStack
        	from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
        	import chat.routing
        
        	application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
        		'websocket': AuthMiddlewareStack(
        			URLRouter(
        				chat.routing.websocket_urlpatterns
        				)
        			)
        	})
        
        
        5. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the chat models.
        
        6. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/ to see 
        	the interface. You can type in a username to find the corresponding 
        	user and open a chatroom with them.
        
        And you're good to go! If you want to contribute to the development of this app,
