**aospy**: automated gridded climate data analysis and management

A framework that enables automated calculations using gridded climate data.
Following some basic description of where your data lives and defining any
functions of variables stored in that data you want to compute, aospy enables
you to fire off an arbitrary number of calculations using that data.
