        Install in Linux
        ================
        If you use Gentoo you can find a ebuild in https://github.com/Turulomio/myportage/tree/master/app-office/didyoureadme
        
        If you use other distribution compatible con pip, you need to install PyQt5 and didyoureadme with the following commands:
        
        `pip install PyQt5`
        
        `pip install didyoureadme`
        
        You need to install PyQt5 first, because is not in Linux setup.py dependencies due to it doesn't use standard setup tools. So for compatibility reasons with distributions like Gentoo, we use this additional step.
        
        Install in Windows as a python module
        =====================================
        You need to install Python from https://www.python.org and add it to the PATH
        
        You must open a console with Administrator privileges and type:
        
        `pip install didyoureadme`
        
        If you want to create a Desktop shortcut to launch didyoureadme you must write:
        
        `didyoureadme.exe --shortcuts-create`
        
        If you want to delete that Desktop shortcut you can write:
        
        `didyoureadme.exe --shortcuts-remove`
        
        Install in Windows as a standalone application
        ==============================================
        You need to download didyoureadme-X.X.X.exe from github release
        
        Just execute it
        
        To create DidYouReadmeDatabase
        ==============================
        Create a postgresql database:
        
        `createdb -U postgres didyoureadme`
        
        `psql -U postgres didyoureadme < sql/didyoureadme.sql`
        
        Run didyoureadme and configure settings
        
        You must grant didyoureadme_user or didyoureadme_admin to your database user
        If you use postgres user, DidYouReadMe gives him both roles
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        * https://www.python.org/, as the main programming language.
        * https://pypi.org/project/colorama/, to give console colors.
        * http://initd.org/psycopg/, to access PostgreSQL database.
        * https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/, as the main library.
        * https://pypi.org/project/pytz/, to work with timezones.
        * https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/, to create shortcuts.
        
        
        Workarounds
        ===========
        - If you have problems with data base, you should see database posmaster.log file
        - Sever time and Client time must be updated
        - Antivirus and Firewall could avoid web server comunications and mail sends
