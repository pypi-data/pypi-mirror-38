This package contains some general meteorological routines 
and some specific routines to work with CM1 and WRF.  The general
routines include generation of Skew-T/Log-P plotting.  The CM1
routines include generation of input soundings for CM1 and
classes for reading CM1 output files in grads and HDF5 format.
