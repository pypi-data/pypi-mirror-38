Description: 
        # Fus
        
        It's a little programming language!
        
        I have embedded it in Python, and uploaded it to PyPi to see how that's done.
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Try the following:
        
            from fus import run
        
            # NOTE: The fus module maintains fus state (defs+stack+vars)
        
            run(r'"Hello!\n"' " ='msg")
            run("'msg str_p")
            # Prints: Hello!
        
            run('def add_and_print of(x y ->): + p')
            run('1 2 +')
            run('10 @add_and_print')
            # Prints: 13
        
            run('asd')
            # Raises RuntimeError
