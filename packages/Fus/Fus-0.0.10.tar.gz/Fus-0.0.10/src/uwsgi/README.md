# Fus UWSGI plugin

For usage instructions, see [uwsgi/README.md](/uwsgi/README.md).


## uwsgi.h

Generated via ``uwsgi --dot-h``.
See [UWSGI docs](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Symcall.html#step-1-preparing-the-environment) for details.
(That page is for the ``--symcall`` option, which fus used at first, but no longer.
However it's also the page which best describes the ``--dot-h`` option.)
