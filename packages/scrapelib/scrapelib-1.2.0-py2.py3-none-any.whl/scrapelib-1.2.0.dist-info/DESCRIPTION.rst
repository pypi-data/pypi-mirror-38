    :alt: Documentation Status

scrapelib is a library for making requests to less-than-reliable websites, it is implemented
(as of 0.7) as a wrapper around `requests <http://python-requests.org>`_.

scrapelib originated as part of the `Open States <http://openstates.org/>`_
project to scrape the websites of all 50 state legislatures and as a result
was therefore designed with features desirable when dealing with sites that
have intermittent errors or require rate-limiting.

Advantages of using scrapelib over alternatives like httplib2 simply using
requests as-is:

* All of the power of the suberb `requests <http://python-requests.org>`_ library.
* HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP requests via an identical API
* support for simple caching with pluggable cache backends
* request throttling
* configurable retries for non-permanent site failures

Written by James Turk <dev@jamesturk.net>, thanks to Michael Stephens for
initial urllib2/httplib2 version
