        A package of tools for composition in just intonation with Python.
        
        Full documentation is available [here](https://jintonic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        David B. Doty's technical definition of just intonation :
        
          *Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can
          be represented by whole-number frequency ratios, with a strongly implied
          preference for the simplest ratios compatible with a given musical purpose.*
        
        You can find a more lyrical definition in the first chapter of his primer,
        which is available online [here](http://www.dbdoty.com/Words/Primer_2.1.html)
        
        I strongly recommend his book : "The Just Intonation Primer". It is listed in
        the references below.
