        About
        -----
        
        `REANA <http://www.reana.io>`_ is a reusable and reproducible research data
        analysis platform. It helps researchers to structure their input data, analysis
        code, containerised environments and computational workflows so that the
        analysis can be instantiated and run on remote compute clouds.
        
        REANA was born to target the use case of particle physics analyses, but is
        applicable to any scientific discipline. The system paves the way towards
        reusing and reinterpreting preserved data analyses even several years after the
        original publication.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - structure research data analysis in reusable manner
        - instantiate computational workflows on remote clouds
        - rerun analyses with modified input data, parameters or code
        - support for several compute clouds (Kubernetes/OpenStack)
        - support for several workflow specifications (CWL, Serial, Yadage)
        - support for several shared storage systems (Ceph)
        - support for several container technologies (Docker)
