        ===========
        
        ECprocessing will provide a variety of useful functions involved in 
        preprocessing. Currently there are only functions for text preprocessing.
         
        Typical usage often looks like this::
        
        
        
            from ecprocessing import text_preprocessing as txp
        
        
            string_to_process = "This string<br> will be pr3processed to cha__nge '£lots of messy párts."
            processed_string = txp.normalize_text(string_to_process)
