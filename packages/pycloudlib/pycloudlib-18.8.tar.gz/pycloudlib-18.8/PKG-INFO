        ## Install
        
        Install directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycloudlib/):
        
        ```shell
        pip3 install pycloudlib
        ```
        
        Project's requirements.txt file can include pycloudlib as a dependency. Check out the [pip documentation](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html) for instructions on how to include a particular version or git hash.
        
        Install from latest master:
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://git.launchpad.net/pycloudlib
        cd pycloudlib

        ## Usage
        
        The library exports each cloud with a standard set of functions for operating on instances, snapshots, and images. There are also cloud specific operations that allow additional operations.
