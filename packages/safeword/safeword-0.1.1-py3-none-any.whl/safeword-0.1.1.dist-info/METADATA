TODO:

    - camelCase, medial capitals, camel caps
    - snake_case, machine safe 
- Hashes, input based md5+, ~~UUID~~ / CUID
- append and prepend (useful for hash + file extension)
- return int
    - even/odd numbers
- machine safe
- ~~return backwards/forwards~~
- integrate with princetonparser when it makes sense to generate/update lists on the fly
    - importable word lists?
- [FEATURE] Emoji returns
- [FEATURE] return url combos
- optimize list creation and availability. currently created during class init
    - should be tested to see if JSON or CSV is faster to generate lists
- [IMPORTANT] refactor request and response flow
