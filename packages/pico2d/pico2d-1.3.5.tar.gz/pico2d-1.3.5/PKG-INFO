Description: Pico2d - Light weight 2D Python wrapper for SDL
        ==================================================
        
        A sample project that exists as an aid to the `Python Packaging User Guide
        <https://packaging.python.org>`_'s `Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
        Projects <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html>`_.
        
        This projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
        development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
        recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.
        
        ----
        
        This is the README file for the project.
        
        The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using `reStructuredText
        <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. It
        will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
        the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
        that purpose.
        
        Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
        usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
        a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
        may be appropriate.
