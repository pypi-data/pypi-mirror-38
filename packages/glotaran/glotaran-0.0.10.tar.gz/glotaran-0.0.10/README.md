# Glotaran
Global and target analysis software package based on Python

## Warning
This project is still in its pre-alpha phase and undergoing rapid development, including changes to the core API, thus it is not production ready.

Proceed at your own risk!

## Additional warning for scientists
The algorithms provided by this package still need to be validated and reviewed, pending the official release it should not be used in scientific publications.

## Installation

To install glotaran, run this command in your terminal:

    pip install glotaran

This is the preferred method to install glotaran, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

## Vagrant

The repository contains a Vagrantfile which sets up a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box with included Jupyter Lab.

After installing [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) simply go to the
repository folder and issue

    vagrant up
    # OR

    vagrant up --provider virtualbox

Note: You will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed.

After running `vagrant up`, open a browser and browse to `localhost:9999` (`127.0.0.1:9999`) or simply doubleclick `open_vagrant-jupyter.html`.

To shut down the box, issue

    vagrant down / halt

To connect (via ssh) and aquire a terminal on the box issue:

    vagrant ssh

To delete it (and remove all traces from your computer)

    vagrant destroy

To update the glotaran-core installation on a vagrant box (without rebuilding it):

    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    sudo python3 setup.py install
    exit
    vagrant reload
