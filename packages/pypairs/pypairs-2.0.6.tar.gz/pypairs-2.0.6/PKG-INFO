Description: # PyPairs - A python scRNA-Seq classifier
        
        This is a python-reimplementation of the _Pairs_ algorithm as described by A. Scialdone et. al. (2015).
        Original Paper available under: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.06.021
        
        The algorithm aims to classify single cells based on their transcriptomic signal. Initially created to predict cell
        cycle phase from scRNA-Seq data, this algorithm can be used for various applications.
        
        It is a supervised maschine learning algorithm and as such it consits of two components: 
        training (sandbag) and prediction (cyclone)
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
        purposes. 
        
        ### Installation
        
        This package is hosted at PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/pypairs/) and can be installed on any system running Python3 
        with:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install pypairs
        ```
        
        ### Minimal example
        
        Assuming you have two scRNA count files (csv, columns = samples, rows = genes) and one annotation file (csv, no header, 
        two rows: "gene, class") a minimal example would look like this:
        
        ```
        from pypairs import wrapper
        
        trainings_matrix = [PATH TO MATRIX]
        annotation = [PATH TO ANNOTATION]
        testing_matrix = [PATH TO MATRIX]
        
        marker_pairs = wrapper.sandbag_from_file(trainings_matrix, annotation)
        
        prediction = wrapper.cyclone_from_file(testing_matrix, marker_pairs)
        ```
