         INTRODUCTION
        -------------------------
        
         This release provides access to the corresponding functionality through
         both public API_KEY and private API_KEY.
        
         The public API_KEY can access the file detection function of the cloud
         sandbox. You need to register for a ThreatBook online account and view
         your API Key through the Personal Center, which will be used for all your
         API operations without submitting via the web, uploading the file/URL for
         analysis and extracting the completed analysis. Report data. The
         ThreatBook Online Sandbox API is a free service available for free websites
         and programs. Please do not use the API for any commercial product or
         service, as an alternative to an anti-virus product, or for any project that
         may directly or indirectly damage the anti-virus industry.
        
        The private API_KEY provides an easy way to invoke data from the
        Threat Analytics Platform database and its detection and analysis
        capabilities from any client. It includes the following functions:
        file digital signature identification, new registered domain query,
        email registration information query, domain analysis, IOC detection,
        IP analysis, IP reputation query, etc. As our business customer or partner,
        we will deliver your corresponding apikey by mail.
