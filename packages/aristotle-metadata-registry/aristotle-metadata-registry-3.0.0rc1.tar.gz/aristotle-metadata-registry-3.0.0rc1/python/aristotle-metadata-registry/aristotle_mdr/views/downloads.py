def download(request, download_type, iid=None):

    By default, ``aristotle_mdr.views.download`` is called whenever a URL matches
    the pattern defined in ``aristotle_mdr.urls_aristotle``::

        download/(?P<download_type>[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+)/(?P<iid>\d+)/?

    This is passed into ``download`` which resolves the item id (``iid``), and
    determines if a user has permission to view the requested item with that id. If
    a user is allowed to download this file, ``download`` iterates through each
    download type defined in ``ARISTOTLE_SETTINGS.DOWNLOADERS``.

    A download option tuple takes the following form form::

        ('file_type','display_name','font_awesome_icon_name','module_name'),

    With ``file_type`` allowing only ASCII alphanumeric and underscores,
    ``display_name`` can be any valid python string,
    ``font_awesome_icon_name`` can be any Font Awesome icon and
    ``module_name`` is the name of the python module that provides a downloader
    for this file type.

    For example, the Aristotle-PDF with Aristotle-MDR is a PDF downloader which has the
    download definition tuple::

            ('pdf','PDF','fa-file-pdf-o','aristotle_pdr'),

    Where a ``file_type`` multiple is defined multiple times, **the last matching
    instance in the tuple is used**.

    Next, the module that is defined for a ``file_type`` is dynamically imported using
    ``exec``, and is wrapped in a ``try: except`` block to catch any exceptions. If
    the ``module_name`` does not match the regex ``^[a-zA-Z0-9\_]+$`` ``download``
    raises an exception.

    If the module is able to be imported, ``downloader.py`` from the given module
    is imported, this file **MUST** have a ``download`` function defined which returns
    a Django ``HttpResponse`` object of some form.

    This is passed into ``bulk_download`` which takes the items GET arguments from the
    request and determines if a user has permission to view the requested items.
    For any items the user can download they are exported in the desired format as
    described in ``aristotle_mdr.views.download``.
