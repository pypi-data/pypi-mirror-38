# extra-context

Sometimes, when you get warnings and exeptions, backtraces are just not enough.
For example, you have a loop with 10.000 iterations. In the 1000th iteration there is an 
exception in a function you called. So you would like to have more context for the error message.

There are 2 options
* give more context at the site the exception occured
  * Only possible if you control the exception/warning generation
  * Sometimes, there is not enough context to begin with (i.e. you are calling some common utility function)
  
* Provide additional context as the exception/warning is passed up the call stack
  * Can be "opt-in" in user-code, no changes in libraries required.
  * Also works for warnings (which normally don't provide backtrace information)

## Examples

The main example that inspired writing this library:
```python
to_process = { "file1": {...}, "file2": {...}, ...}

for k, v in to_process.items():
    cleaned = clean_data(v)
    write_output(k, cleaned)
```

If there is an exception or warning somewhere in `clean_data(v)`, the "context" i.e. from which
file the data came is lost. The backtrace could look something like:
```
  File "clean.py", line 35, in clean_data
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Now, with this library you can give extra context to your error messages

```python
from extra_context import provide_extra_context

to_process = { "file1": {...}, "file2": {...}, ...}

for k, v in to_process.items():
    with provide_extra_context(filename=k):
        cleaned = clean_data(v)
        write_output(k, cleaned)
```

This would report the same error as:
```
  File "clean.py", line 35, in clean_data
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
  |- In context: filename='file4'
```

### Decorator
There is also a decorator that reports the function arguments in case of an error

```python
import warnings
from extra_context import provide_call_context

@provide_call_context
def w(x):
    warnings.warn("Oops")

w(42)
```

This reports:
```
UserWarning: Oops
  |- In context: w(42)
  warnings.warn("Oops")
```
