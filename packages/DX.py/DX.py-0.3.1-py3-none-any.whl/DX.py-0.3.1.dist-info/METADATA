**The DX Network is a protocol to standardise the exchange of structured data by creating domain-specific data marketplaces.**
Each marketplace is defined by a [data model](https://docs.dx.network/#data-models) specified in OWL and enables data owners and consumers to sell/buy data from each other programmatically.
The [first marketplace](https://docs.dx.network/#dx-tech-industry-model) on the DX Network allows for the exchange of structured data about technology companies, products, news, investors and investments.

### Getting Started

1. *(Optional)* Install Python 3 by following the guide for your choice of OS [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).<br />
> On Windows, replace `pip3` and `python3` with `pip` and `python` in the following commands. Activate the virtual environment by replacing `source env/bin/activate` with `env\Scripts\activate.bat`. 

2. *(Optional)* Setup a virtual environment by running:<br/>
```shell
python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the DX package by running:
```shell
pip3 install DX.py
```

4. Download the example script from the `examples` folder ([link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDXNetwork/dx-sdk-python/master/examples/DX-examples.py)). 

5. Replace the arguments of `DX.wallet.load` with a wallet filename and password that has Testnet (*Ropsten*) DX Tokens and Ethers. [Get in touch](mailto:info@dx.network) if you need Testnet DX Tokens or Ethers.

6. Run the modified script:
```shell
python3 DX-examples.py
```
