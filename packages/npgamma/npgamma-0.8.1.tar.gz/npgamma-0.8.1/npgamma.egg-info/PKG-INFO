Description: 
        `npgamma` is deprecated. A known bug in this version
        of npgamma is that the evaluation and reference grid
        definitions are flipped. This has flow on effects
        to parameters such as the lower_dose_threshold and
        simply swapping evaluation and reference grids may
        not achieve the desired results.
        
        `npgamma` is superceded by `pymedphys.gamma`.
