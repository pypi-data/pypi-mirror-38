        =================
        
        
        This SDK uses the Requests library and will work for Python ```2 >=2.7.9``` and Python ```3 >=3.4```.
        
        How to configure:
        =================
        The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. 
        To do that, open the file "Configuration.py" and edit its contents.
        
        How to resolve dependencies: 
        ===========================
        The generated code uses Python packages named requests, jsonpickle and dateutil.
        You can resolve these dependencies using pip ( https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ ).
        
          1. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
          2. Invoke ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
        
        Note: You will need internet access for this step.
        
        How to use:
        ===========
        After having resolved the dependencies, you can easily use the SDK following these steps.
        
          1. Create a "earthport-rest-api-client_test.py" file in the root directory.
          2. Use any controller as follows:
        ```python
        from __future__ import print_function
        from earthport-rest-api-client.earthport_rest_api_client_client import EarthportRestApiClientClient
        
        api_client = EarthportRestApiClientClient()
        controller = api_client.quotes
        response = controller.create_bulk_fx_quote(<required parameters if any>)
        
        print(response.fx_ticket_id)
        
        # Or you can print more information
        print(vars(response))
        ```
