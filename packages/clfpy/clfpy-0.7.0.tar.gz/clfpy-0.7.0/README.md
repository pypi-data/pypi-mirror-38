# `clfpy` â€“ Python library for accessing infrastructure services in CloudFlow and its derivatives
This is a simple Python library that offers access to infrastructure services
in CloudFlow and its derivatives. The library aims to make things like
interaction with GSS (file upload, download, etc.) as easy and hassle-free as
possible.

## Changelog
###2018-11-27: Version 0.7.0
* (MINOR) File upload and download now shows a status bar and the average speed
  by default.

###2018-10-31: Version 0.6.2
* (PATCH) Bugfix: GSS test script fails with Python 2.7

###2018-10-31: Version 0.6.1
* (PATCH) Bugfix: Uploading an empty file fails

## Implemented clients
Currently, the following clients are available:
* `clfpy.AuthClient`: Client for the authentication manager
* `clfpy.AuthUsersClient`: Client for the users interface of the authentication
  manager
* `clfpy.AuthProjectsClient`: Client for the projects interface of the
  authentication manager
* `clfpy.GssClient`: Client for accessing the generic storage services (GSS)
* `clfpy.HpcImagesClient`: Client for registering Singularity images with the
  CloudFlow HPC client
* `clfpy.WfmClient`: Client for interacting with the workflow manager (does not
  yet expose the full WFM functionality)

## Requirements
Requires Python 2.7 or Python 3.x.

## Installation
`clfpy` can be installed from the Python Package Index using pip:
```shell
pip install clfpy
```

## How to use
Have a look at the `clfpy/tests/` folder to find examples on how to use the
library.

## Development
### How to upload a new version to PyPi
1. Make changes to the code
2. Run test scripts with Python 2.7 _and_ Python 3.x.
3. Update the changelog and choose a new version number using semantic
   versioning.
4. Update the version number in `setup.py`.
5. Remove all files from `./dist` to avoid attempting to overwrite existing
   files when uploading.
6. Run `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` and check the resulting files in
   `./dist`.
7. Run `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload` to upload to PyPi.
   Note that this step requires a correctly configured `~/.pypirc` file.
