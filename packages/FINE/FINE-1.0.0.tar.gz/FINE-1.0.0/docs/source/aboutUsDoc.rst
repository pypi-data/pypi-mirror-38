We are the `Process and Systems Analysis <http://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/Forschung/_Process-and-System-Analysis/_node.html>`_
department at the `Institute of Energy and Climate Research: Electrochemical Process Engineering (IEK-3)
<http://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/Home/home_node.html>`_ belonging to the Forschungszentrum Jülich. Our
interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and
system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and
costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems.
Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s
greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and
by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
