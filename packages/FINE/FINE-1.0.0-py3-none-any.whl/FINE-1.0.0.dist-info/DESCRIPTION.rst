# FINE - Framework for Integrated Energy System Assessment

The FINE python package provides a framework for modeling, optimizing and assessing energy systems. With the provided framework, systems with multiple regions, commodities and time steps can be modeled. Target of the optimization is the minimization of the total annual cost while considering technical and enviromental constraints. Besides using the full temporal resolution, an interconnected typical period storage formulation can be applied, that reduces the complexity and computational time of the model.

If you want to use FINE in a published work, please [**kindly cite following publication**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421830879X) which gives a description of the first stages of the framework. The python package which provides the time series aggregation module and its corresponding literatur can be found [**here**](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam).

## Features
* representation of an energy system by multiple locations, commodities and time steps
* complexity reducing storage formulation based on typical periods

## Installation
Install via pip by cloning a local copy of the repository to your computer

	git clone https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE.git

Alternatively, you can download it as ZIP file.

Then install FINE via pip as follow

	cd FINE
	pip install . 

Or install directly via python as 

	python setup.py install


## Examples

A [**first example**](examples/Multi-regional%20Energy%20System%20Workflow/Multi-regional%20Energy%20System%20Workflow.ipynb) shows the capabilites of FINE as jupyter notebook

We are the [Process and Systems Analysis](http://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/Forschung/_Process-and-System-Analysis/_node.html) department at the [Institute of Energy and Climate Research: Electrochemical Process Engineering (IEK-3)](http://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/Home/home_node.html) belonging to the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Governmentâ€™s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
