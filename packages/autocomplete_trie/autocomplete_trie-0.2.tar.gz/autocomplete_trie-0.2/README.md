# autocomplete_trie

This package implements a class `trie` that is database for terms and associated weights. The class implements 
a fast autocomplete method, as well as methods to add terms to the trie, delete terms from the trie, prune the trie,
and rescale all weights in the trie. The class can be used as the back-end implementation of autocomplete for a database.
