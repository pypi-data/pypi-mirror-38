        ## Running Hello World
        
        Ravestate applications are defined by a configuration,
        that specifies the ravestate modules that should be loaded.
        
        To run the basic hello world application, run ravestate with the proper config file:
        
        ```bash
        ./run.sh -f config/hello_world.yml
        ```
        
        ## Running tests
        
        If you have installed the dependencies from ``requirements-dev.txt`` you
        may run the ravestate test suite as follows:
        
        ```bash
        ./run_tests.sh
        ```
