        # Requirements:
        seqtag
        
        ```
        from deepsegment import DeepSegment
        # the config file can be found at in the pre-trained model zip. Change the model paths in the config file before loading. 
        # Since the complete glove embeddings are not needed for predictions, "glove_path" can be left empty in config file
        segmenter = DeepSegment('path_to_config')
