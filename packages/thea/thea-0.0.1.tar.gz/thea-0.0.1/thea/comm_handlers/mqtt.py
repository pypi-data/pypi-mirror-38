"""A comm_handler is a function that handles communication to hardware

A comm handling function has the following requirements/characteristics:
- It will always be run in a separate process.
- It starts out by connecting to its targets.
- It terminates the processes if a connection could not be established.
- It processes messages from a Queue object.
- A message is a tuple of an address and data.
- First argument is the message queue
- Other arguments are passes as kwargs and should be defined in communicator_types.py


How is new hardware handled??
How to handle a failed message that has already been removed from the queue??
