Thea is used to control the environment of model (train) layouts based
on real-world data and simulation models. Current development is focused
around lighting ðŸŒ„ but we plan to expand the functionalities to include
sound ðŸ”‰ and actuator control.

## ðŸŒ± Origin

This project was started in order to control lighting of model-train
layouts in more interesting ways. Most solutions only offer manual
and rule based control resulting in very predictive behavior. Thea
breaks with this by controlling the model environment based on real-word
data and simulation models that introduce an element of randomness.

## âœ… Principles

-   Science based environment simulation;
-   Simple to start but complex if you want to;
-   Modern user interface;
-   Support for common hardware;

## âœ¨ Features

Currently Thea is in early development so the list of available features
is a bit short. However we have a lot planned:

-   [x] Accelerated model time
-   [ ] Day and night cycle ðŸŒ“
-   [ ] Hardware control over MQTT
-   [ ] Household lighting
-   [ ] Weather patterns ðŸŒ€
-   [ ] Traffic ðŸš—
-   [ ] Opening-hours ðŸ•“
-   [ ] Graphical user interface
-   [ ] Moon and stars ðŸŒ›âœ¨
-   [ ] DCC train control ðŸš‚
-   [ ] Weather sounds ðŸ”‰
