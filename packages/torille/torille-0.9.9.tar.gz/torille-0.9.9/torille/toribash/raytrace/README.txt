Toribash PovRay Exporter
------------------------

Quick Start
-----------

1. Download PovRay from http://www.povray.org
2. Start Toribash,load a replay and take a screenshot (f8)
- This will create a file named "screenshot.pov"
3. Click on the screenshot.pov (should open in povray)
4. Render (Render -> Start Rendering)

Modding
-------

The exporter comes with two include files (glossy.inc, clean.inc).

Change the #include "clean.inc" directive in 
screenshot.pov to switch between them.

To experiment with your own color schemes, lightnings etc you 
should change the include files.
