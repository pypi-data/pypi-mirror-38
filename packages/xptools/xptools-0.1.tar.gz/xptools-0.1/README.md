# ImageAnalysis
Tools to display images, detect particles, bubbles and crystals and analyze their shape, size and distibution.

## Image analysis

- analyze_particles.py: Returns a regionprop object containing the bright on dark particles detected on the image

## Display tools

- display_image_matrix.py: Arranges all the images in a directory as a matrix and saves the resulting image

## Notebooks

- BroadSpectrumTesting.ipynb: Tests different image analysis techniques to determine which is most appropriate
- FocusedAnalysis.ipynb: Implements a specific analysis and plots the resulting size and number distributions for the particles
