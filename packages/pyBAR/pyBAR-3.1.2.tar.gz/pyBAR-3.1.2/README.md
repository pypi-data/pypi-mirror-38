pyBAR - Bonn ATLAS Readout in Python

PyBAR is a versatile readout and test system for the ATLAS FEI4(A/B) pixel readout chip. It uses the [basil](https://github.com/SiLab-Bonn/basil) framework to access the readout hardware.
PyBAR's FPGA firmware and host software includes support for different hardware platforms.

PyBAR is *not only* targeting experienced users and developers. The easy-to-use scripts allow a quick setup and start. PyBAR is a very flexible readout and test system and provides the capability to conduct tests and characterization measurements of individual chips, and tests of large-scale detectors with multiple multi-chip modules and multiple readout boards.

The features of the FPGA firmware in a nutshell:
- supported readout boards:
  any hardware that is supported by basil (e.g., MIO2, MIO3, and MMC3)
- supported adapter cards:
  Single Chip Adapter Card, Burn-in Card (Quad Module Adapter Card) and the General Purpose Analog Card (GPAC)
- readout of multiple readout boards
- readout of multiple multi-chip modules (e.g., single, dual, quad module, and any combination of those)
- simultaneous readout (e.g., data taking with external trigger, individual tuning of chips)
- continuous data taking
- individual and automatic data to clock phase alignment on each channel
- full support of EUDAQ TLU and availability of EUDAQ Producer

The features of the host software in Python:
- no GUI
- support for Windows, Linux and macOS
- scan/tuning/calibration algorithms are implemented in stand-alone scripts
- scripts are implemented for operating single chips but are working with multi-chip configurations as well
- fast development and implementation of new scan/tuning/calibration algorithms
- configuration files are human readable (compatible to RCE/HSIO)
- full control over FEI4 command generation, sending any arbitrary bit stream and configuration sequence to the FEI4
- recording of the full input data stream with timestamps and storage of the compressed data to HDF5 files
- ultra fast raw data analysis, event and cluster building, and raw data validity checks
- real-time online monitor with GUI

## Experiments

The pyBAR readout system was extensively used for various high-energy particle physics experiments as well as detector R&D.
