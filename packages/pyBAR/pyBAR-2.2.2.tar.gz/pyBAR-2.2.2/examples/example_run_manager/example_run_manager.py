    # During the first run, an module data directory relative to the configuration.yaml file will be created.
    # If configuration.yaml is placed inside /host/pybar/ the module data will be stored inside /host/pybar/<module_id> (where <module_id> is defined inside configuration.yaml).

    # press Ctrl-C to abort the run at any time
    # Each scan has a default run configuration, which is defined inside the corresponding scan file in /host/pybar/scans/.
    # It is not necessary to add run parameters to the primlist file. If not given they are taken from the default run configuration (_default_run_conf).

    status = runmngr.run_run(run=AnalogScan, run_conf="example_run_manager_run_config.txt")  # using no thread

            print 'ERROR! This error was made by intention!'
            break  # jump out
    #
    # The configuration.yaml can be extended to change the default run parameters for each scan:
    #
    # (from configuration.yaml)
    # AnalogScan:
    #     scan_parameters : {'PlsrDAC': 100} # inject 100 PlsrDAC
    #     enable_shift_masks : ["Enable", "C_Low"] # use C_Low only
    #
    # It is recommended to keep a copy of configuration.yaml for each module.
