This contains packaging tools and example notebooks for the Python
interface to [lifelib](https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib). You
probably want to consult that README instead of this one.

Setup guide
-----------

Install lifelib. This may be as simple as:

    pip install --user --upgrade python-lifelib

or running the (standalone!) `install.py` script in this repository.

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/python-lifelib.git

Spin up a notebook server:

    cd python-lifelib/notebooks
    jupyter notebook
