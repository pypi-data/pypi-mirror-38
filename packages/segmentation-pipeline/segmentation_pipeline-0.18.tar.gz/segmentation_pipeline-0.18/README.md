## Motivation

Idea for this project came from my first attempts to participate in Kaggle competitions. My programmers heart was painfully damaged by looking on my own code as well as on other people kernels. Code was highly repetitive, suffering from numerous reimplementation of same or almost same things through the kernels, model/experiment configuration was oftenly mixed with models code, in other words from programmer perspective it all looked horrible. 

So I decided to extract repetitive things into framework that will work at least for me, and that will follow to this statements: 
 - experiment configurations should be cleanly separated from model definitions.
 - experiment configuration files should be easy to compare, and should fully describe experiment that is being performed except of the dataset
- common blocks like an architecture, callbacks, storing model metrics, visualizing network predictions, should be written once and should be a part of common library


## Installation

```
pip install segmentation_pipeline
```

## Usage guide

### Training a model

Let's start from the absolutely minimalistic example. Let's say that you have two folders, one of them contains
jpeg images, and another one - png files containing segmentation masks for them. And you need to train a neural network
that will do segmentation for you. In this extremly simple setup all that you need to do is to do is to type following 5

lines of python code:
```python
from segmentation_pipeline.impl.datasets import SimplePNGMaskDataSet
from segmentation_pipeline import  segmentation
ds=SimplePNGMaskDataSet("D:/pics/train","D:/pics/train_mask")
cfg = segmentation.parse("config.yaml")
cfg.fit(ds)
```

Looks simple, but there is a `config.yaml` file in the code, and probably it is the place where everything actually happens.

```yaml
backbone: mobilenetv2 #lets select classifier backbone for our network 
architecture: DeepLabV3 #lets select segmentation architecture that we would like to use
augmentation:
 Fliplr: 0.5 #let's define some minimal augmentations on images
 Flipud: 0.5 
classes: 1 #we have just one class (mask or no mask)
activation: sigmoid #one class means that our last layer should use sigmoid activation
encoder_weights: pascal_voc #we would like to start from network pretrained on pascal_voc dataset
shape: [320, 320, 3] #This is our desired input image and mask size, everything will be resized to fit.
optimizer: Adam #Adam optimizer is a good default choice
batch: 16 #Our batch size will be 16
metrics: #We would like to track some metrics
  - binary_accuracy 
  - iou
primary_metric: val_binary_accuracy #and most interesting metric is val_binary_accuracy
callbacks: #Let's configure some minimal callbacks
  EarlyStopping:
    patience: 15
    monitor: val_binary_accuracy
    verbose: 1
  ReduceLROnPlateau:
    patience: 4
    factor: 0.5
    monitor: val_binary_accuracy
    mode: auto
    cooldown: 5
    verbose: 1
loss: binary_crossentropy #We use simple binary_crossentropy loss
stages:
  - epochs: 100 #Let's go for 100 epochs
```

So as you see, we have decomposed our task in two parts, *code that actually trains model* and *experiment configuration*,
which determines model and how it should be trained from the set of predefined building blocks.
 
What this code actually does behind of the scenes?

-  it splits you data in 5 folds, and trains one model per fold
-  it takes care about model checkpointing, generates example image/mask/segmentation triples, collects training metrics. All this data will
   be stored in the folders just near your `config.yaml`
-  All you folds are initialized from fixed default seed, so different experiments will use exactly same train/validation splits     

#### Custom datasets

Training data and masks are not necessary stored in files, so sometimes you need to declare your own dataset class,
for example the following code was used in my experiments with [Airbus ship detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/overview)
to decode segmentation masks from rle encoded strings stored in csv file 

```python
from segmentation_pipeline.impl.datasets import PredictionItem
import os
from segmentation_pipeline.impl import rle
import imageio
import pandas as pd

class SegmentationRLE:

    def __init__(self,path,imgPath):
        self.data=pd.read_csv(path);
        self.values=self.data.values;
        self.imgPath=imgPath;
        self.ship_groups=self.data.groupby('ImageId');
        self.masks=self.ship_groups['ImageId'];
        self.ids=list(self.ship_groups.groups.keys())
        pass
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.masks)


    def __getitem__(self, item):
        pixels=self.ship_groups.get_group(self.ids[item])["EncodedPixels"]
        return PredictionItem(self.ids[item] + str(), imageio.imread(os.path.join(self.imgPath,self.ids[item])),
                              rle.masks_as_image(pixels) > 0.5)


    
```         

#### Balancing your data

One often case is the situation when part of your images, does not contain any objects of interest, like in 
[Airbus ship detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/overview), more over your data may
be to heavily inbalanced, so you may want to rebalance it, alternatively you may want to inject some additional
images that does not contain objects of interest, to decrease amount of false positives that is produced by framework.
    
This scenarious are supported by `negatives` and `validation_negatives` settings of training stage configuration,
this settings accept following values:

- none - exclude negative examples from the data
- real - include all negative examples 
- integer number(1 or 2 or anything), how many negative examples should be included per one positive example   

if you are using this setting your dataset class must support `isPositive` method which returns true for indexes
that contain positive examples: 

```python        
    def isPositive(self, item):
        pixels=self.ddd.get_group(self.ids[item])["EncodedPixels"]
        for mask in pixels:
            if isinstance(mask, str):
                return True;
        return False
```        

#### Multistage training

Sometimes you need to to split your training in several stages, you can easily do it by adding several stage entries
in your experiments configuration file like in the following example:

```yaml
stages:
  - epochs: 6 #Train for 6 epochs
    negatives: none #do not include negative examples in your training set 
    validation_negatives: real #validation should contain all negative examples    

  - lr: 0.0001 #let's use different starting learning rate
    epochs: 6
    negatives: real
    validation_negatives: real

  - loss: lovasz_loss #lets override loss function
    lr: 0.00001
    epochs: 6
    initial_weights: ./fpn-resnext2/weights/best-0.1.weights #lets load weights from this file    
```

stage entries allow you to configure custom learning rate, balance of negative examples, callbacks, loss function
and even initial weights that should be used on a particular stage.

#### Composite losses

Framework support composing loss as a weighted sum of predefined loss functions. For example following construction
```yaml
loss: binary_crossentropy+0.1*dice_loss
```
will result in loss function which is composed from `binary_crossentropy` and  `dice_loss` functions

#### Cyclical learning rates

![Example](https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR/blob/master/images/triangularDiag.png?raw=true)

As told in [Cyclical learning rates for training neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186) CLR policies can provide quicker converge for some neural network tasks and architectures 

![Example2](https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR/raw/master/images/cifar.png)

We support them by adopting Brad Kenstler [CLR callback](https://github.com/bckenstler/CLR) for Keras

If you want to use them just add `CyclicLR` in your experiment configuration file as shown in this example: 

```yaml
callbacks:
  EarlyStopping:
    patience: 40
    monitor: val_binary_accuracy
    verbose: 1
  CyclicLR:
     base_lr: 0.0001
     max_lr: 0.01
     mode: triangular2
     step_size: 300
```

#### LR Finder

[Estimating optimal learning rate for your model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186) is an important thing, we support this by using slightly changed 
version of [Pavel Surmenok - Keras LR Finder](https://github.com/surmenok/keras_lr_finder)

```python
cfg= segmentation.parse("people.yaml")
ds=SimplePNGMaskDataSet("./train","./train_mask")
finder=cfg.lr_find(ds,start_lr=0.00001,end_lr=1,epochs=5)
finder.plot_loss(n_skip_beginning=20, n_skip_end=5)
plt.show()
finder.plot_loss_change(sma=20, n_skip_beginning=20, n_skip_end=5, y_lim=(-0.01, 0.01))
plt.show()
```
will result in this couple of helpful images:

#### Background Augmenter

One interesting augentation option when doing background removal task is replacing backgrounds with random 
images, we support this with `BackgroundReplacer` augmenter:

```yaml
augmentation:
  BackgroundReplacer:
    path: D:/bg #path to folder with backgrounds
    rate: 0.5 #fraction of original backgrounds to preserve

```

### Using trained model

Okey, our model is trained, now we need to actually do image segmenation, let's say that we need to run image segmentation on
images in the directory and store results in csv file:

```python
from segmentation_pipeline import  segmentation
from segmentation_pipeline.impl.rle import rle_encode
from skimage.morphology import remove_small_objects, remove_small_holes
import pandas as pd

#this is our callback that is called for every image
def onPredict(file_name, img, data):
    threshold = 0.25
    predictions = data["pred"]
    imgs = data["images"]
    post_img = remove_small_holes(remove_small_objects(img.arr > threshold))
    rle = rle_encode(post_img)
    predictions.append(rle)
    imgs.append(file_name[:file_name.index(".")])
    pass

cfg= segmentation.parse("config.yaml")

predictions = [],images = []
#Now lets use best model from fold 0 to do image segmentation on images from images_to_segment
cfg.predict_in_directory("D:/images_to_segment", 0, onPredict, {"pred": predictions, "images": images})

#Let, store results in csv
df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({'image': images, 'rle_mask': predictions})
df.to_csv('baseline_submission.csv', index=False)
``` 
#### Ansembling predictions

Okey, what if you want to ansemble model from a several folds, just - pass list of fold numbers to
`predict_in_directory` like in the following examples:

```python
cfg.predict_in_directory("D:/images_to_segment", [0,1,2,3,4], onPredict, {"pred": predictions, "images": images})
```
another supported option is to ansemble results from extra test time augmentation (flips), by adding keyword arg `ttflips=True`
  
### Custom evaluation code

Some times you need to run custom evaluation code, to do this you may use: `evaluateAll` method, which provides an iterator
on the batches containing, original images, training masks, and predicted masks

```python
for batch in cfg.evaluateAll(ds,2):
    for i in range(len(batch.predicted_maps_aug)):
        masks = ds.get_masks(batch.data[i])
        for d in range(1,20):
            cur_seg = binary_opening(batch.predicted_maps_aug[i].arr > d/20, np.expand_dims(disk(2), -1))
            cm = rle.masks_as_images(rle.multi_rle_encode(cur_seg))
            pr = f2(masks, cm);
            total[d]=total[d]+pr
```

### Accessing model
You may get trained keras model, by using following call: ```cfg.load_model(fold, stage)```

## Analyzing Experiments Results

Okey, we have done a lot of experiments and now we need to compare the results, and understand what works best. This repository
contains [script](segmentation_pipeline/analize.py) which may be used to analyze folder containing sub folders
with experiment configurations and results. This script gathers all configurations diffs them by doing structural diff, then 
for each configuration if averages metrics all folds and  generates csv file containing metrics and parameters that
was actually changed in your experiment like in the following [example](report.csv) 
 
## What is supported?

At this moment segementation pipeline support following architectures:

- Unet
- Linknet
- PSP
- FPN
- DeeplabV3

`FPN`, `PSP`, `Linkenet`, `UNet` architectures supports following backbones: 

  - vgg16 
  - vgg19 
  - resnet18
  - resnet34
  - resnet50 
  - resnet101
  - resnet152
  - resnext50
  - resnext101 
  - densenet121
  - densenet169
  - densenet201
  - inceptionv3 
  - inceptionresnetv2

All them support has support for the weights pretrained on imagenet:
```yaml
encoder_weights: imagenet
```

At this moment `DeeplabV3` architecture supports following backbones:
 - mobilenetv2
 - xception

Deeplab supports weights pretrained on pacal_voc

```yaml
encoder_weights: pascal_voc
``` 

Each architecture also supports some specific options, list of options is documented in [segmentation RAML library](segmentation_pipeline/schemas/segmentation.raml#L166).

Supported augmentations are documented in [augmentation RAML library](segmentation_pipeline/schemas/augmenters.raml)

Callbacks are documented in [callbacks RAML library](segmentation_pipeline/schemas/callbacks.raml)  

## Custom architectures, callbacks, metrics

Segmentation pipeline uses keras custom objects registry to find entities, so if you need to use
custom loss function,activation or metric all that you need to do is to register it in Keras as: 

```python
keras.utils.get_custom_objects()["my_loss"]= my_loss
```

If you want to inject new architecture, you need to register it in `segmentation.custom_models` dictionary

for example:
```python
segmentation.custom.models['MyUnet']=MyUnet 
```
where `MyUnet` is a function that accepts architecture parameters as keyword arguments and returns an instance
of keras model
