Description: dwilib
        ======
        
        *NEW: Switched to Python version 3, it is now required and assumed everywhere!*
        
        Tools in development to support analysis of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)
        data, with focus on prostate cancer.
        
        This software is being developed as part of a research project at the `Magnetic
        Resonance Imaging Research Center <http://mrc.utu.fi/>`_, Turku, Finland.
        
        Note: This is very much under construction. The program code is being written on
        demand basis, for custom needs at in-house projects. It has grown organically at
        the same time as the programmer has been studying the subject and learning the
        tools. So the code is quite messy in many places.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        - Read input data as DICOM, or in custom ASCII or MATLAB formats
        - Perform model fitting (Monoexponential ADC, Kurtosis, Stretched exponential,
          Biexponential)
        - Calculate correlation with Gleason score
        - Calculate and compare diagnostic ROC AUCs
        - Calculate reproducibility measures
        - Plotting schemes
        - Viewer for multi-slice, multi-b-value DWI DICOM files (uses the Matplotlib GUI
          widget)
        - Build tool for automated pipelining of data processing tasks
        
        
        Todo or In Progress
        -------------------
        - Improved documentation
        - Improved build tool
        - Autonomous tumor delineation/ROI placement
