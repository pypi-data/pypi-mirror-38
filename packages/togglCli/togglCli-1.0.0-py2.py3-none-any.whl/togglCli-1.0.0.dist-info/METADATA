Overview
--------

toggl-cli is a command-line interface for toggl.com.

It certainly does not implement the full toggl API, but rather some core
functions. The goal is to make using toggl quicker and more efficient for those
already familiar with command-line tools.

toggl-cli is written in Python and uses version 8 of the [toggl
API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs) (thanks to beauraines for the
help).

Latest Update
-------------

**15 Dec 2014**: Thanks to [FedericoVaga](https://github.com/FedericoVaga)
`.togglrc` now supports API token authentication. You will need to add
`api_token` to the `auth` section, and `prefer_token` to the `options` section.

**11 Nov 2014**: Major refactoring into a more MVC OO structure.

**30 Oct 2014**: Added a feature that starting, stopping, and continuing an
entry prints out the time it started or stopped. This requires a new option in
~/.togglrc: `time_format = %I:%M%p` is the default.  See
[strftime()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior)
for more options.

Requirements
------------

* iso8601 module
* pytz module
* requests
* python-dateutil

Configuration
-------------

Upon first running the program, a configuration file `~/.togglrc` will be
automatically created. 

1. Update that file with your toggl username and password.
2. Update the timezone entry (e.g. US/Pacific).

#### Continue Behaviour ####

Setting `continue_creates` to false will cause `continue` to continue already existing same-day entries as a duration continuation, rather than create a new entry.  `continue_creates` defaults to false for toggl-cli users where `.togglrc` already exists, and to true for new users as per the default of the toggl web UI.

Limitations
-----------

* When creating a time entry for a given project, the project must already
  exist.
* Project users, tasks, tags, and users aren't supported.
* Only the default workspace is supported.

Roadmap
