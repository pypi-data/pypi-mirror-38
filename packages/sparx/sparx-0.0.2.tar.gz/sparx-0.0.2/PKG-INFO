        Sparx is a Python module for data preprocessing and wrangling built on top of
        Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn and distributed under the 1-Clause BSD license.
        
        The project was started in 2017 by **Bastin Robins**, **Vandana Bhagat**, **Pallavi Murthy** as a CleverInsight Hack Challenge, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
        the `AUTHORS.rst <AUTHORS.rst>`_ file for a complete list of contributors.
