It currently uses `curio` as its\nmeans of establishing connections.\n\nIt is fully type-hinted and MPD responses are typed as well, so it is able to\nplay nicely with `mypy` and autocompletion such as what is provided by `jedi`.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nFirst a basic usage example. `make()` returns a connected client as a context\nmanager that handles disconnection automatically.\n\n```python\nasync def main():\n    async with MPDClient.make('localhost', 6600) as m:\n        await m.play()\n```\n\nThe IdleClient class provides the `idle()` function. Since `ampdup` is\n`async`/`await`-based this loop can easily run concurrently with other\noperations.\n\n```\nasync def observe_state():\n    async with IdleClient.make('localhost', 6600) as i:\n        while True:\n            changed = await i.idle()\n            handle_changes(changed)\n```\n\nTodo\n====\n\n- [ ] Support command lists.\n- [ ] Support connecting through Unix socket.\n- [ ] Support the more obscure MPD features such as partitions.\n",
