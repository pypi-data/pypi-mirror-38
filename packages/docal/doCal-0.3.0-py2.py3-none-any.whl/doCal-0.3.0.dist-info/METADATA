# doCal

doCal is a scientific report document calculation assistant that aims to reduce the routine code used inside Python chunks in Pweave and/or PythonTEX documents. While embedding python code inside a document is a big advantage, it is still required to format Python calculations output and equations to LaTeX form. Thus the user still has to write significantly more code to make the results flow with the surrounding document. This library intends to solve that problem.

## Features
* Automatic calculation and unit conversion and handling (idea from Mathcad, using Sympy units)
* Automatic formatting of equations, calculations and results into LaTeX form (using Sympy)
* LaTeX (.tex) file output that can be converted to other formats via pandoc (including MS Word .docx)
* Clear LaTeX formatted calculation procedure output

### An Example:
Inside a Pweave source document the user (having imported necessary modules and defined variables) writes
```latex
...
The area moment of inertia is:

<%cal('I_R = (b*(h**3))/12 - ((b-2*t)*(h-2*t)**3)/12')%>

The center of gravity is
...
```
Now when the file is weaved into a .tex file, the above is converted into:
```latex
...
The area moment of inertia is:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
I_{R}	&= \frac{b}{12} \cdot h^{3} - \frac{1}{12} \cdot \left(b - 2 \cdot t\right) \cdot \left(h - 2 \cdot t\right)^{3}\\
		&= \frac{5\,\mathrm{cm}}{12} \times \left(11\,\mathrm{cm}\right)^{3} - \frac{1}{12} \times \left(5\,\mathrm{cm} - 2 \times 1\,\mathrm{mm}\right) \times \left(11\,\mathrm{cm} - 2 \times 1\,\mathrm{mm}\right)^{3}\\
		&= 5.07(10^{-07})\,\mathrm{m^{4}}\\
\end{split}
\end{align}

The center of gravity is
...
```
which, when compiled to pdf will look like

## Installation
It can be installed using pip:
```
pip install doCal
```
Currently, the package provides two functions: ```eqn``` for formatting equations (no calculations), ```fmt``` for formatting individual quantities, and ```cal``` for calculations.

### Note:
The project is currently under development and since I am not experienced, any suggestion or contribution is welcome.
