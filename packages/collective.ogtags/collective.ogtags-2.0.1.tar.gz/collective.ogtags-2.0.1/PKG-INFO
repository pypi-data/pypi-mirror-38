Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This packages provides Open Graph tags similar to those built in in plone 5.
        Basically this started as a backport the social media viewlet of
        plone.app.layout in plone 5 to plone 4. However, in Plone 5.X still misses
        some extra features and fixes from collective.ogtags, so v2 of collective.ogtags
        has been made compatible with Plone 5.
        
        What is Open Graph
        ==================
        
        Open Graph is a specification developed by Facebook to provide information
        about a webpage. This information is used by social media sites to get title,
        author, description, url, images and more in order to create a marked up link.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
         - add collective.ogtags to your eggs and run buildout
         - go to the add-ons page in the plone control panel and install
           collective.ogtags
         - If you use custom image fields write an adapter for
           collective.ogtags.interfaces.IOGTagsImageProvider and your content-type to
           get this image (optional because collective.ogtags already registers the
           adapters for generic dexterity and archetype CT searching for "image" and
           "leadImage" fields)
        
        
        Settings
        ========
        
        Go to the ogtags settings in the plone control panel. Provide as much of the
        following settings as possible:
        
         - Site name:
                Provide the name of your site here.
         - Facebook username:
                Provide your facebook username. You can find this by going to your
                facebook page. The format is:
                ``https://www.facebook.com/<facebook_username>``
         - Facebook app id:
                Provide your facebook app id. Go to
                https://developers.facebook.com/apps, choose your app and look for
                your app id in the description.
         - Twitter username:
                Provide your twitter name. The @-sign included, for example:
                ``@zestsoftware``
         - Default image:
                Provide the URL to an image to be used in case no other image can be
                found. By default this will be ``/logo.png``.
