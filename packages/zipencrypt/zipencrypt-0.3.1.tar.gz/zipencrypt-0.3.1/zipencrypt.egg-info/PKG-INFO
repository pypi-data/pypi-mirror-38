Description: zipencrypt
        ==========
        
        zipencrypt is a Python module to provide *weak* password-based
        encryption for zipfiles. It is meant as a drop-in replacement for
        zipfile from the standard lib and provides the counterpart to the
        decryption implemented there.
        
        It is implemented in pure python and does not rely on any 3rd party libraries.
        
        Compatible to python 2.7 and 3.4+
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install zipencrypt
        
        The code
        --------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from zipencrypt import ZipFile
        
            with ZipFile("file.zip", mode="w") as f:
                f.writestr("file1.txt", "plaintext", pwd=b"password")
        
        Do not use this!
        ----------------
        
        The standard encryption of ZIP is known to be seriously flawed (see
        `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)#Encryption>`_).
        That is probably the reason why it is not implemented in zipfile in the
        standard lib. There are however legitimate use cases.
