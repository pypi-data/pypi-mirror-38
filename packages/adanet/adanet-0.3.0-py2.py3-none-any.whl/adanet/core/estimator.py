class Estimator(tf.estimator.Estimator):
  """The AdaNet algorithm implemented with the `tf.estimator.Estimator` API.

  AdaNet is as defined in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01097.

  The AdaNet algorithm uses a weak learning algorithm to iteratively generate a
  set of candidate subnetworks that attempt to minimize the loss function
  defined in Equation (4) as part of an ensemble. At the end of each iteration,
  the best candidate is chosen based on its ensemble's complexity-regularized
  train loss. New subnetworks are allowed to use any subnetwork weights within
  the previous iteration's ensemble in order to improve upon them. If the
  complexity-regularized loss of the new ensemble, as defined in Equation (4),
  is less than that of the previous iteration's ensemble, the AdaNet algorithm
  continues onto the next iteration.

  AdaNet attempts to minimize the following loss function to learn the mixture
  weights 'w' of each subnetwork 'h' in the ensemble with differentiable
  convex non-increasing surrogate loss function Phi:

  Equation (4):

    F(w) = 1/m * sum_{i = 1 to m}(Phi(1 - y_i * sum_{j = 1 to N}(w_j * h_j)))
           + sum_{j = 1 to N}(Gamma_j * |w_j|)

    where Gamma_j = lambda * r_j + beta, with lambda >= 0 and beta >= 0.

  This implementation uses an `adanet.subnetwork.Generator` as its weak learning
  algorithm for generating candidate subnetworks. These are trained in parallel
  using a single graph per iteration. At the end of each iteration, the
  estimator saves the sub-graph of the best subnetwork ensemble and its weights
  as a separate checkpoint. At the beginning of the next iteration, the
  estimator imports the previous iteration's frozen graph and adds ops for the
  next candidates as part of a new graph and session. This allows the estimator
  have the performance of Tensorflow's static graph constraint (minus the
  performance hit of reconstructing a graph between iterations), while having
  the flexibility of having a dynamic graph.

  NOTE: Subclassing `tf.estimator.Estimator` is only necessary to work with
  `tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate` which asserts that the estimator argument is
  a `tf.estimator.Estimator` subclass. However, all training is delegated to a
  separate `tf.estimator.Estimator` instance. It is responsible for supporting
  both local and distributed training. As such, the AdaNet `Estimator` is only
  responsible for bookkeeping across iterations.

    """Initializes an `Estimator`.

    Regarding the options for `mixture_weight_type`:

    A `SCALAR` mixture weight is a rank 0 tensor. It performs an element-
    wise multiplication with its subnetwork's logits. This mixture weight
    is the simplest to learn, the quickest to train, and most likely to
    generalize well.

    A `VECTOR` mixture weight is a tensor of shape [k] where k is the
    ensemble's logits dimension as defined by `head`. It is similar to
    `SCALAR` in that it performs an element-wise multiplication with its
    subnetwork's logits, but is more flexible in learning a subnetworks's
    preferences per class.

    A `MATRIX` mixture weight is a tensor of shape [a, b] where a is the
    number of outputs from the subnetwork's `last_layer` and b is the
    number of outputs from the ensemble's `logits`. This weight
    matrix-multiplies the subnetwork's `last_layer`. This mixture weight
    offers the most flexibility and expressivity, allowing subnetworks to
    have outputs of different dimensionalities. However, it also has the
    most trainable parameters (a*b), and is therefore the most sensitive to
    learning rates and regularization.

    Args:
      head: A `tf.contrib.estimator.Head` instance for computing loss and
        evaluation metrics for every candidate.
      subnetwork_generator: The `adanet.subnetwork.Generator` which defines the
        candidate subnetworks to train and evaluate at every AdaNet iteration.
      max_iteration_steps: Total number of steps for which to train candidates
        per iteration. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle,
        training stops before `max_iteration_steps` steps.
      mixture_weight_type: The `adanet.MixtureWeightType` defining which mixture
        weight type to learn in the linear combination of subnetwork outputs.
      mixture_weight_initializer: The initializer for mixture_weights. When
        `None`, the default is different according to `mixture_weight_type`.
        `SCALAR` initializes to 1/N where N is the number of subnetworks in the
        ensemble giving a uniform average. `VECTOR` initializes each entry to
        1/N where N is the number of subnetworks in the ensemble giving a
        uniform average. `MATRIX` uses `tf.zeros_initializer`.
      warm_start_mixture_weights: Whether, at the beginning of an iteration, to
        initialize the mixture weights of the subnetworks from the previous
        ensemble to their learned value at the previous iteration, as opposed to
        retraining them from scratch. Takes precedence over the value for
        `mixture_weight_initializer` for subnetworks from previous iterations.
      adanet_lambda: Float multiplier 'lambda' for applying L1 regularization to
        subnetworks' mixture weights 'w' in the ensemble proportional to their
        complexity. See Equation (4) in the AdaNet paper.
      adanet_beta: Float L1 regularization multiplier 'beta' to apply equally to
        all subnetworks' weights 'w' in the ensemble regardless of their
        complexity. See Equation (4) in the AdaNet paper.
      evaluator: An `Evaluator` for candidate selection after all subnetworks
        are done training. When `None`, candidate selection uses a moving
        average of their `Ensemble`'s AdaNet loss during training instead. In
        order to use the *AdaNet algorithm* as described in [Cortes et al.,
        '17], the given `Evaluator` must be created with the same dataset
        partition used during training. Otherwise, this framework will perform
        *AdaNet.HoldOut* which uses a holdout set for candidate selection, but
        does not benefit from learning guarantees.
      report_materializer: A `ReportMaterializer` for materializing a
        `Builder`'s `subnetwork.Reports` into `subnetwork.MaterializedReport`s.
        These reports are made available to the Generator at the next iteration,
        so that it can adapt its search space. When `None`, the Generators'
        `generate_candidates` method will receive empty Lists for their
        `previous_ensemble_reports` and `all_reports` arguments.
      use_bias: Whether to add a bias term to the ensemble's logits. Adding a
        bias allows the ensemble to learn a shift in the data, often leading to
        more stable training and better predictions.
      replicate_ensemble_in_training: Whether to freeze a copy of the ensembled
        subnetworks' subgraphs in training mode in addition to prediction mode.
        A copy of the subnetworks' subgraphs is always saved in prediction mode
        so that at prediction time, the ensemble and composing subnetworks are
        all in prediction mode. This argument only affects the outputs of the
        frozen subnetworks in the ensemble. When `False` and during candidate
        training, the frozen subnetworks in the ensemble are in prediction mode,
        so training-only ops like dropout are not applied to them. When `True`
        and training the candidates, the frozen subnetworks will be in training
        mode as well, so they will apply training-only ops like dropout. However
        when `True`, this doubles the amount of disk space required to store the
        frozen ensembles, and increases the preparation stage between boosting
        iterations. This argument is useful for regularizing learning mixture
        weights, or for making training-only side inputs available in subsequent
        iterations. For most use-cases, this should be `False`.
      adanet_loss_decay: Float decay for the exponential-moving-average of the
        AdaNet objective throughout training. This moving average is a data-
        driven way tracking the best candidate with only the training set.
      worker_wait_timeout_secs: Float number of seconds for workers to wait for
        chief to prepare the next iteration during distributed training. This is
        needed to prevent workers waiting indefinitely for a chief that may have
        crashed or been turned down. When the timeout is exceeded, the worker
        exits the train loop. In situations where the chief job is much slower
        than the worker jobs, this timeout should be increased.
      model_dir: Directory to save model parameters, graph and etc. This can
        also be used to load checkpoints from the directory into a estimator to
        continue training a previously saved model.
      report_dir: Directory where the `adanet.subnetwork.MaterializedReport`s
        materialized by `report_materializer` would be saved. If
        `report_materializer` is None, this will not save anything. If `None` or
        empty string, defaults to "<model_dir>/report".
      config: `RunConfig` object to configure the runtime settings.
