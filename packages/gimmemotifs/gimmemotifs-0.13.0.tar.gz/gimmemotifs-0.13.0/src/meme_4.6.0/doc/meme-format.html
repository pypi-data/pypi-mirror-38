      <h1>MEME Suite Motif File Formats</h1>
      <h3>Output Formats</h3>
      <p>MEME results are recorded in three file formats:
      <a href="examples/meme_example_output_files/meme.txt">plain text</a>, 
      <a href="examples/meme_example_output_files/meme.html">HTML</a>,
      and <a href="examples/meme_example_output_files/meme.xml">XML</a>.
      The MEME <b>XML</b> format is completely specified by the 
	<a href="./meme.dtd">Document Type Definition (DTD)</a>
      found at the start of the MEME XML output.
      The MEME <b>plain text</b> and <b>HTML</b> formats contain much explanatory text and
      are thus self-documenting.
      The XML format was added for MEME 4.0.
      The plain text and HTML formats have been supported in all versions of MEME.
      <p>
      GLAM2 provides 
      <a href="examples/glam2_example_output_files/glam2.txt">plain text</a> 
      and 
      <a href ="examples/glam2_example_output_files/glam2.html">HTML</a>
      output. 
      The format is described in the
      <a href="glam2_tut.html#output_format">Output format</a> section of
      the <a href="./glam2_tut.html">GLAM2 Tutorial</a>.
      GLAM2 also provides <a href="#min_format">MEME minimal motif format</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Input Formats</h3>
      <p>
      MAST will accept the plain text, HTML, and XML forms of MEME output, and the
	<a href="#min_format">MEME minimal motif format</a>.
      <!-- <a href="./mast.html#motif_format">MAST documentation</a> Broken link-->. 
      </p>
      <p>
      FIMO will accept the plain text, HTML, and XML forms of MEME output, and the

      <h2>MEME Minimal Motif Format</h2>
      <p>
      Users may create motif files in a simplified
      format for use by the MEME Suite programs.      
      Examples are given in the sample files below.
      <table border="1">
        <tr><td></td>
          <th>For All Programs Except MAST</th>
          <th>For MAST</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>DNA</th>
          <td><a href="../examples/sample-dna-motif.meme-io">sample</a></td>
          <td><a href="../examples/sample-dna-motif.mast-io">sample</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr><th>Protein</th>
          <td><a href="../examples/sample-protein-motif.meme-io">sample</a></td>
          <td><a href="../examples/sample-protein-motif.mast-io">sample</a></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>

      <p>
      The meaning of the format is as follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li><b>The MEME version number line.</b>
	      <pre>MEME version 4.5</pre>

	<li>
	  <b>The alphabet line.</b>
	  <br/>
	  For DNA motif files the line
	    <pre>ALPHABET= ACGT</pre>
	  or for protein motif files
	    <pre>ALPHABET= ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY</pre>
	  must be present.

	</li>

	<br/>
	<li>
	  <b>Strand information line.</b>  (DNA motif files only.) 
	  <br/>
	  If both DNA strands are included in the motif:
	  <pre>strands: + -</pre> 
	  or if only one strand is included:
	  <pre>strands: +</pre>
	</li>

	<li><b>The background distribution lines.</b>
	  <br/>
	  The background must start a new line with the string:
	  <pre>Background letter frequencies (from</pre>
	  This is followed, on the next line(s),
	  by a list of characters and their associated frequencies,
	  delimited by white space.
	</li>

	<br/>
	<li><b>The motifs.</b>
	  <br/>
	  There may be one or more motifs.  
	  Each motif starts with a "<b>MOTIF</b>" line, followed by a "<b>log-odds matrix</b>"
	  and/or a "<b>letter-probability matrix</b>" section.
	  MAST requires each motif to be represented as a "<b>log-odds matrix</b>".
	  For all other programs that accept MEME minimal motif format, each motif must be represented as a 
          "<b>letter-probability matrix</b>".
	  You may include both formats for a given motif but only one will be used,
	  depending on which program you are running.  If you include both formats
	  for a motif, you should put the log-odds matrix format first.
          Each of the sections has a header line followed by one line of letter 
          score/frequencies for each position in the motif, as detailed below.
    It is recommended, though not required, that you included a URL line listing
    the webpage where more information can be found on the motif.
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	  <b>The motif format for MAST is:</b>
	  <br/>
	  <pre>
MOTIF motif_name
log-odds matrix: alength= 4 w= 22 E= 0
  ...
  ... lines of log-odds scores; each line is list of scores for each letter ... 
  ...
URL website
	  </pre>
	  <b>The motif format for all other programs that accept MEME minimal motif format is:</b>
	  <pre>
MOTIF motif_name 
letter-probability matrix: alength= 4 w= 22 nsites= 49 E= 0
  ...
  ... lines of probabilities; each line is list of probabilities of each letter ... 
  ...
URL website
	  </pre>
	  The first line should be exactly as shown, except the word "<b>motif_name</b>"
	  should be replaced with the name of the motif, which may be any word (without spaces).
          <br/>
	  <b>Note:</b> If you included log-odds and letter-probability formats for a given
	  motif, only include the "<b>MOTIF name</b>" line once, just above the "<b>log-odds</b>" line.
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	  The "<b>log-odds matrix</b>" header has the values "<b>alength</b>" for the
	  size of the alphabet (4 for DNA, 20 for protein), 
          "<b>w</b>" for the number of positions in the motif, and "<b>E</b>" for the 
          <i>E</i>-value of the motif (in most cases this can be set to zero).
	  The "<b>letter-probability matrix</b>" header has the values "<b>alength</b>", 
	  "<b>w</b>" and "<b>E</b>" as above, with the addition of "<b>nsites</b>", specifying
          the number of sites that were used in creating the motif.
          <br />
          <br />
	  The log-odds or probabilities for the motif are listed "rotated".  That is each line
	  represents a "column" or "position" within the motif.  There should be "<b>w</b>"
          lines.  Each line specifies "<b>alength</b>" log-odds scores or probabilities,
	  one for each letter in the alphabet.
	  Within a line, scores or probabilities are listed for each letter in the order of the
    motif alphabet.
    <br />
    <br/>
    The last line is optional, but if included should have the word "<b>website</b>" 
    replaced with the web address of more information on the motif.
        </li>
      </ol>
     
<!--
      <li> The motif occurrence section.  
	<br\>
      This section is optional and is preceded by the line
      <br />
      <code> &lt;INPUT TYPE = HIDDEN NAME = motif-summary VALUE = &quot;
      </code>
      <br />
      Each subsequent line contains the motif occurrence information from
      one sequence in the training set.  Each line begins with the sequence
      id, sequence p-value, number n of motif occurrences, and the length of
      sequence.  The four values are followed by n triples, each
      corresponding to one motif occurrence.  Each triple consists of the
      motif id, its occurrence position in the sequence, and the motif
      occurrence p-value.  The motif occurrence section must end with a line
      containing only a quotation mark followed by a greater-than
      symbol:<br /> <code>&quot;&gt;</code>
      </li>

      <li><b>Note:</b></li>
	  Older versions of MEME produce a matrix of probabilities rather than
	  frequencies (i.e., the prior is applied to the frequencies).
	  The old version is indicated by having <code>n=</code> 
	  rather than <code>nsites=</code> in the
	  header for the letter probability matrix.  
	  If your MEME output file is from a previous version of MEME, 
	  you will receive the following message:
	  <pre>
	    Warning: This is an old MEME file that contains
	    posterior probabilities rather than frequencies.
	    Meta-MEME will still work, but it would be better
	    to run an updated version of MEME on your data.
	  </pre>
	  </li>
