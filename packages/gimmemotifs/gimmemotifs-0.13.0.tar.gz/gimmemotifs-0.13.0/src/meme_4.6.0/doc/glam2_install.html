<h1>GLAM2 Installation</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The only requirement is a C compiler. If you have some kind of
Unix or Linux system, you almost certainly have one already. If you have
Mac OS X, you may need to install a developer toolkit, which should come
for free with Mac OS X. If you have Windows, you can get a C compiler
from various places, such as <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>
or <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.</p>

<h2>Usual procedure</h2>

<p>This procedure should be suitable in most cases.</p>

<ol>

	<li>You presumably obtained GLAM2 as a zipped package, called
	something like glam2-9999.zip. The first step is to unzip it, creating
	a new directory glam2-9999.</li>

	<li>Using the command line, move into the src subdirectory and
	type 'make'. This should compile the glam2 programs.</li>

	<li>To compile purge, move into the purge subdirectory and type
	'make'.</li>

	<li>After successful compilation, the programs are ready to use.
	Run them just by typing their names (possibly with leading ./ depending
	on the settings for your command line environment). If you like, you
	can put the programs in standard 'bin' directories, or add their
	location to your system's PATH.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/glam2">Debian
package</a>.</p>

<p>The Makefile in the src subdirectory holds the commands for
compiling the glam2 programs. (Likewise for the purge subdirectory.) The
commands are customized for the widely-used <a
	href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> compiler. To use a different
compiler, you may have to modify the Makefile. The Makefile is very
simple and commented, so this should be doable even if you know nothing
about makefiles. However, you will obviously need to know what commands
are suitable for your compiler. Use compiler options that make the
resulting programs as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The programs can also be compiled directly, without 'make'. For
instance, to compile glam2mask, move into the src subdirectory and type:</p>

<pre>
cc -Wall -O3 -o glam2mask glam2mask.c alignment.c fasta.c util.c -lm
</pre>

<p>Modify as appropriate for your compiler. Look in the Makefile for
commands to compile the other programs.</p>
