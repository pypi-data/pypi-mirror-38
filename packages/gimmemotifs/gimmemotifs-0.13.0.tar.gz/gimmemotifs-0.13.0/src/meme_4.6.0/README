                           Introduction             
=============================================================================
The  MEME system provides online tools for discovering  and using protein and 
DNA sequence motifs.  A motif is a pattern of nucleotides or amino acids that 
appears repeatedly in a group of related  DNA or protein sequences.  The MEME 
system represents motifs as position-dependent scoring matrices. 

The MEME system consists of two programs which allow you to: 
  meme - for discovery of motifs shared by a group of sequences and, 
  mast - for search of databases for sequences containing these motifs. 

You can download the ANSI C source code for MEME system from
http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/meme-download.html

You can also use the MEME system via its website at http://meme.nbcr.net

                        Using MEME/MAST
=============================================================================
To find out how to use MEME or MAST execute:
    meme
or
    mast

The usage will be printed on stdout.

                          Developers Notes
=============================================================================
Detailed notes are given in the MEME wiki: 
  https://nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MEME_Developers%27_Guide

1. Check out from svn (you have to have read/write access to this svn):
    svn checkout svn+ssh://meme@summit.ucsd.edu/meme/SVNROOT/trunk

2. To create a distribution tar ball meme_VERSION.tar.gz.  (Note: the
	version number is set in configure.ac using variable
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.)
    cd trunk
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make dist
