Description: # Zenoh Python API
        
        [Zenoh](http://zenoh.io) is an extremely efficient and fault-tolerant [Named Data Networking](http://named-data.net) (NDN) protocol 
        that is able to scale down to extremely constrainded devices and networks. 
        
        The Python API is for pure clients, in other terms does not support peer-to-peer communication, can be easily
        tested with our demo instace available at **demo.zenoh.io**.

            $ python3 setup.py install
        
        Notice that on some platforms, such as Linux, you will need to do this as *sudo*.
        
        ## Installing the API from PyPi
        You can also install the [zenoh](http://zenoh.io)'s python API from PyPi by  simply doing:

            $ python3 sub.py -z demo.zenoh.io
