  libuuid - Faster UUID generation using libuuid
#########################################################

A Python C extension for faster generation of `UUID`_ objects. It supports
libuuid-based generation of version 1 and 4 UUIDs. The library is fully
compatible with the `standard uuid module`_, while also providing specialized,
optimized, functions for generating `UUID`_ strings.

``libuuid`` is roughly 8-10 times faster than the pure-python version.

It's basically just a thin `Cython`_ wrapper around `libuuid by Theo Tso`_.

This module has been forked from `python-libuuid`_ by Daniel Lundin. Daniel
has not updated the module since 2010, and has not responded to pull requeststs
or attempts to take over maintenance. The upstream module does not support Python 3.

Installation
------------

You can install ``libuuid`` either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from source.

To install using ``pip``::

    $ pip install libuuid


To install using ``easy_install``::

    $ easy_install libuuid

If you have downloaded a source tarball you can install it by doing the
following,::

    $ python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install # as root


Usage / Examples
----------------

The ``libuuid`` module provides a similar interface to ``uuid``, resulting in fully
compatible UUID objects. ``libuuid.UUID`` is also a subclass of ``uuid.UUID``,
so existing code using ``isinstance`` will continue to work.

    >>> import libuuid
    >>> libuuid.uuid1()
    UUID('a3a32410-940a-11df-8ead-002219990fd7')

    >>> libuuid.uuid4()
    UUID('85651a1f-118f-480d-a116-526b2dd37322')

Furthermore, ``libuuid`` has a few extra utility functions not available in
``uuid``. These are handy when you don't need a "full" UUID object, but just
need the byte representation. The ``_bytes`` functions have less overhead than
the common interface.

    >>> libuuid.uuid1_bytes()
    '\x05f\xe1d\x94\x0b\x11\xdf\x8e\xad\x00"\x19\x99\x0f\xd7'

    >>> libuuid.uuid4_bytes()
    '\x05f\xe1d\x94\x0b\x11\xdf\x8e\xad\x00"\x19\x99\x0f\xd7'


Gotchas
-------

 * ``libuuid`` only provides random (version 4) and time based (version 1) UUIDs.

 * Calling ``libuuid.uuid1`` with `node` or `clock_seq` is not supported, and will
   silently fall back to the ``uuid.UUID`` implementation for compatibility.

 * Only tested on Linux. It should work on any platform, but e2fsprogs is
   probably just readily available on Linux distributions.
