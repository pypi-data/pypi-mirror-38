# Submission Gateway
# Use as a modular component for adapter to interact with submission
# If submission JSON does not contain version field or version is 1, gcloud compute instances ssh
# If submission JSON contains version and version is 2, ssh -i {lapdog ssh token} {instance ip}
# If SSH fails for any reason, save the exception and try reading the log
# If the log is not found, then you're SOL
