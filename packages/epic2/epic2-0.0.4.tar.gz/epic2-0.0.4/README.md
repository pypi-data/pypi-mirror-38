# epic2

epic2 is an ultraperformant reimplementation of SICER. It focuses on speed, low memory overhead and ease of use.

#### Features

* easy to install and use
* reads sam, single-end bam, bed and bedpe (.gz)
* extremely fast
* very low memory requirements
* works both with and without input
* metadata for ~80 UCSC genomes built in
* easily use custom genomes and assemblies with --chromsizes and --effective-genome-fraction args

#### Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:endrebak/epic2.git
cd epic2
python setup.py install
epic2 -t examples/test.bed -c examples/control.bed > results.txt
```

#### Install

The installation currently requires bioconda htslib to be installed for setup.py
to find the appropriate headers. I will update the install script with more ways
to include the headers.

```
pip install epic2
```

#### CLI

```

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --treatment TREATMENT [TREATMENT ...], -t TREATMENT [TREATMENT ...]
                        Treatment (pull-down) file(s) in one of these formats:
                        bed, bedpe, bed.gz, bedpe.gz or (single-end) bam, sam.
                        Mixing file formats is allowed.
  --control CONTROL [CONTROL ...], -c CONTROL [CONTROL ...]
                        Control (input) file(s) in one of these formats: bed,
                        bedpe, bed.gz, bedpe.gz or (single-end) bam, sam.
                        Mixing file formats is allowed.
  --genome GENOME, -gn GENOME
                        Which genome to analyze. Default: hg19. If
                        --chromsizes and --egf flag is given, --genome is not
                        required.
  --keep-duplicates, -kd
                        Keep reads mapping to the same position on the same
                        strand within a library. Default: False.
  --bin-size BIN_SIZE, -bin BIN_SIZE
                        Size of the windows to scan the genome. BIN-SIZE is
                        the smallest possible island. Default 200.
  --gaps-allowed GAPS_ALLOWED, -g GAPS_ALLOWED
                        This number is multiplied by the window size to
                        determine the number of gaps (ineligible windows)
                        allowed between two eligible windows. Must be an
                        integer. Default: 3.
  --fragment-size FRAGMENT_SIZE, -fs FRAGMENT_SIZE
                        (Single end reads only) Size of the sequenced
                        fragment. Each read is extended half the fragment size
                        from the 5' end. Default 150 (i.e. extend by 75).
  --false-discovery-rate-cutoff FALSE_DISCOVERY_RATE_CUTOFF, -fdr FALSE_DISCOVERY_RATE_CUTOFF
                        Remove all islands with an FDR below cutoff. Default
                        0.05.
  --effective-genome-fraction EFFECTIVE_GENOME_FRACTION, -egf EFFECTIVE_GENOME_FRACTION
                        Use a different effective genome fraction than the one
                        included in epic2. The default value depends on the
                        genome and readlength, but is a number between 0 and
                        1.
  --chromsizes CHROMSIZES, -cs CHROMSIZES
                        Set the chromosome lengths yourself in a file with two
                        columns: chromosome names and sizes. Useful to analyze
                        custom genomes, assemblies or simulated data. Only
                        chromosomes included in the file will be analyzed.
