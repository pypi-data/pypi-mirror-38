About
*****
``avbroadcast`` can republish media streams for mass consumption.
It is a wrapper around the fine ffmpeg_ and packager_ programs,
so it is standing on the shoulders of giants.

.. _ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/
.. _packager: https://github.com/google/shaka-packager/


.. attention::

    Please note the functionality is based on the new `HTTP upload feature`_
    of Shaka Packager which is a work in progress. It is currently living
    in the `http-upload branch`_ and is being tracked at `issue #149`_.

    Please use the beta-build `packager-linux`_ for your own experiments.

.. _http-upload branch: https://github.com/3QSDN/shaka-packager/tree/http-upload
.. _packager-linux: https://packages.elmyra.de/3q/foss/packager-linux
