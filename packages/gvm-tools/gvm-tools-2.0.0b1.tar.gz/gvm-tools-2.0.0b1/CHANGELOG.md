# gvm-tools 2.0.0.beta1 (13.11.2018)

gvm-tools got split into the command line interfaces (*gvm-cli* and
*gvm-pyshell*) including the [gmp (example) scripts](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools/tree/master/scripts)
and the Python API. The Python API can now be found at
[python-gvm](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm). During this split the
python package name for the API got changed from **gmp** to **gvm**. The API
has also been refactored and stabilized. For details please take a look at
[python-gvm](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm).

## Scripts

- It's now possible to write OSP scripts. Using the --protocol=OSP switch
  gvm-pyshell adds a global **osp** object instead of the **gmp** one.
- The `__name__` variable is set to `__gmp__` for GMP scripts and to `__osp__`
  for OSP scripts *(Remember: for normal Python scripts `__name__` is set to
  [`__main__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html))*.
- Scripts are only getting two global variables now: **gmp** (or **osp**)
  and **args**. **gmp** and **osp** are the global objects to communicate with
  the remote *gvmd* or *ospd* daemon. **args** contains the parsed arguments for
  the script.
- The global **args** object only contains script related parameters now. These
  username and password from the --gmp-username and --gmp-password switches and
  the additional scripts parameters as `args.argv`.
- GMPError got renamed to GvmError and must be imported from gvm.errors module.
  ```python
  from gvm.errors import GvmError as GMPError
  ```
- Added new client helper module.
- pretty function isn't available as a global function in the scripts anymore.
  It must be imported separately like
  ```python
  from gvmtools.helper import pretty_print as pretty
  ```
- The included [gmp scripts](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools/tree/master/scripts)
  have been cleaned up and adjusted for the new API.
- It's possible to get the current versions of gvm-tools via `__version__` and
  python-gvm via `__api_version__`.

## Other

- Removed experimental gvm-dialog application.
- Use pipenv for development.
