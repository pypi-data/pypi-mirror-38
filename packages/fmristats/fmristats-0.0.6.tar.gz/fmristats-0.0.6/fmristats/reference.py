        Sets the reference space of the fMRI experiment

        This will define the reference space of an fMRI experiment and

        Parameters
        ----------
        scan_references : Affines or ndarray, shape (n,4,4), dtype: float
            The rigid body transformations.  Affine transformations that
            map coordinates, given with respect to the rigid body, to
            the coordinates of these points in (physical) scanner space
            at the time of the respected scan.

        Notes
        -----
        In particular, this function will set the scan references and
        their respected inverses.  In fact, the reference space is
        solely defined through these affine transformations.  A scan
        reference is a rigid body transformation that maps a point in
        the reference space :math:`R` to the coordinates of this point
        in in scanner space :math:`V` during the respected scan, in
        signs:

        :math:`ρ_t: R \to V`

        Note that the map goes from *reference* to *specific* (from
        *the* scan to *some* scan or from *fixed* to *moving*).

        The reference space is typically set by a function that fits
        head movements to observed intensities at a fixed (say, scanner
        specific) grid, e.g., `fit`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : None or Affine or ndarray, shape (4,4), dtype: float
            an affine transformation or None (default)
        cycle : int
            index of a scan cycle or None

        Notes
        -----
        This will reset the coordinates system of the reference space by
        moving origin and base vectors to the new position specified by
        the affine transformation x.  The affine transformation goes
        **from this** reference space **to the new** reference. If the
        affine transformation has the form Ax+b, then b is the new
        origin and A defines the new orientation.

        If x=None, then x will be set to the mean of the scan
        references.

        Scan references are the maps :math:`ρ_t` which go from scanner
        space to reference space. If the new reference space is
        :math:`R':=x[R]`, then the new scan references are

        .. math::

        significantly from all other volumes, as these likely are the
        result of severe head movement during this particular
        measurement period.

        Grubbs' test is used recursively for the outlier detection. The
        norm of all three semi axis length and each single semi axis
        length is tested for outlier separately.
