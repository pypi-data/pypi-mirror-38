About xarray-simlab
===================

xarray-simlab provides a framework for easily building custom computational
models from a set of modular components (i.e., Python classes), called
processes.

The framework handles issues that scientists who are developing models
should not care too much about, like the model interface and the
overall workflow management. Both are automatically determined from
the succint, declarative-like interfaces of the model processes.

Notably via its xarray extension, xarray-simlab has already deep
integration with the SciPy / PyData stack. Next versions will
hopefully handle other technical issues like command line integration,
interactive visualization and/or running many simulations in parallel,
e.g., in the context of sensitivity analyses or inversion procedures.

Motivation
----------

xarray-simlab is being developped with the idea of reducing the gap between the
environments used for building and running computational models and the ones
used for processing and analyzing simulation results. If the latter environments
become more powerful and interactive, progress has still to be done for the
former ones.

xarray-simlab also encourages building new models from re-usable sets of
components in order to avoid reinventing the wheel. In many cases we want to
customize existing models (e.g., adding a new feature or slightly modifying
the behavior) instead of building new models from scratch. This modular
framework allows to do that with minimal effort. By implementing models using
a large number of small components that can be easily plugged in/out, we
eliminate the need of hard-coding changes that we want to apply to a model,
which often leads to over-complicated code and interface.

The design of this tool is thus mainly focused on both fast model development
and easy, interactive model exploration. Ultimately, this would optimize the
iterative back-and-forth process between ideas that we have on how to model a
particular phenomenon and insights that we get from the exploration of model
behavior.

Sources of inspiration
----------------------

xarray-simlab leverages the great number of packages that are part of the
Python scientific ecosystem. More specifically, the packages below have been
great sources of inspiration for this project.

- xarray_: xarray-simlab actually provides an xarray extension for setting and
  running models.
- attrs_: a package that allows writing Python classes without
  boilerplate. xarray-simlab uses and extends attrs for writing
  processes as succinct Python classes.
- luigi_: the concept of Luigi is to use Python classes as re-usable units that
  help building complex workflows. xarray-simlab's concept is similar, but
  here it is specific to computational (numerical) modeling.
- django_ (not really a scientific package): the way that model
  processes are designed in xarray-simlab has been initially inspired
  from Django's ORM (i.e., the ``django.db.models`` part).
- param_: another source of inspiration for the interface of processes
  (more specifically the variables that it defines).
- climlab_: another python package for process-oriented modeling, which uses
  the same approach although having a slightly different design/API, and which
  is applied to climate modeling.
- landlab_: like climlab it provides a framework for building model
  components but it is here applied to landscape evolution
  modeling. It already has a great list of components ready to use.
- dask_: represents fine-grained processing tasks as Directed Acyclic Graphs
  (DAGs). xarray-simlab models are DAGs too, where the nodes are interdepent
  processes. In this project we actually borrow some code from dask
  for resolving process dependencies and for model visualization.
