        Function converts recursively an object of standard (im-)mutable types into
        strictly immutable ones.
        
        
        Long description
        ================
        
        In Python sometimes it is useful to have a "static" struct to be shared across
        functions and classes and to guarantee it can not be changed accidentally
        by some code.
        
        In addition to standard immutable simple types (like int, str etc.), there are
        two complex types: `frozenset` and `tuple`. Unfortunately years ago (2012-02)
        there was PEP-0416[1] where a `frozendict` was rejected as hard to be
        implemented.
        
        Unlike other wrappers implementation here works similar to a `copy.deepcopy`
        function which immediately copies mutable objects into immutable analogues
        instead of wrapping them at access time. Therefore if a code passes already
        immutable object, there is almost no overhead, but the code do not need to pay
        attention whether to deepcopy of incoming (or outgoing) data or not.
