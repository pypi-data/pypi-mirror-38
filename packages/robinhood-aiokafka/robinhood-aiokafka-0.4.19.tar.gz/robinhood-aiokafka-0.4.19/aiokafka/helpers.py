    Simple helper, that creates an SSLContext based on params similar to
    those in ``kafka-python``, but with some restrictions like:

            * ``check_hostname`` is not optional, and will be set to True
            * ``crlfile`` option is missing. It is fairly hard to test it.

    .. _load_cert_chain: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html\
        #ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain

    Arguments:
        cafile (str): Certificate Authority file path containing certificates
            used to sign broker certificates. If CA not specified (by either
            cafile, capath, cadata) default system CA will be used if found by
            OpenSSL. For more information see `load_verify_locations`_.
            Default: None
        capath (str): Same as `cafile`, but points to a directory containing
            several CA certificates. For more information see
            `load_verify_locations`_. Default: None
        cadata (str/bytes): Same as `cafile`, but instead contains already
            read data in either ASCII or bytes format. Can be used to specify
            DER-encoded certificates, rather than PEM ones. For more
            information see `load_verify_locations`_. Default: None
        certfile (str): optional filename of file in PEM format containing
            the client certificate, as well as any CA certificates needed to
            establish the certificate's authenticity. For more information see
            `load_cert_chain`_. Default: None.
        keyfile (str): optional filename containing the client private key.
            For more information see `load_cert_chain`_. Default: None.
        password (str): optional password to be used when loading the
            certificate chain. For more information see `load_cert_chain`_.
            Default: None.
