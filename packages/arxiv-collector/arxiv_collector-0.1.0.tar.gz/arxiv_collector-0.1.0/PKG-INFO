Description: A small script to collect your LaTeX files for submission to the arXiv.
        
        Main features:
        
        - By default, strips potentially-embarrassing comments from your uploaded `.tex` files.
        
        - Includes the necessary parts of any system package you tell it to upload. By default, this includes biblatex (if you use it) to avoid errors like
        
        > Package biblatex Warning: File '<file>.bbl' is wrong format version
        
        - Only uploads things you actually use: if you have an image you're not including anymore or whatever, doesn't upload it.
        
        
        Requirements:
        
        - A working installation of [`latexmk`](http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8/software/latexmk/), on your PATH.
        
        
        The script has only really been tested on my own projects; let me know if you run into any problems.
