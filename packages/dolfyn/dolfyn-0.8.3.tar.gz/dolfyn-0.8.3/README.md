DOLfYN is the Doppler Oceanography Library for pYthoN.

DOLfYN includes libraries for reading binary Nortek(tm) and
Teledyne-RDI(tm) data files.  At this point it is designed to read and
work with Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) and Acoustic Doppler
Profiler (ADP/ADCP) data.  If you have a data file of one of these
formats that is not read by DOLfYN, contact the DOLfYN development
team.  If you have suggestions of other data-file formats that should
be added to DOLfYN, contact the development team.

DOLfYN includes a data abstraction layer that enables saving and
loading of data after it has been read from the binary files and
processed.
