        Multiscale imaging at LOCI
        ===================
        
        This library holds tools for multiscale imaging projects at the Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation.
        It holds tools for image registration, for interfacing with several toolkits (e.g. CurveAlign), and other processing
        tasks based on project.
        
        
        ## Motivation
        
        
        ## Submodules
        
        This project includes several submodules.  Each submodule includes a "task_scripts" sub-submodule 
        with scripts written for specific image analysis pipelines at LOCI
        
        itk: Tools for supervised registration using the SimpleITK toolkit
        
        microscopy: Interfacing with the LOCI program OpenScan and related microscopy files
        
        polarimetry: Processing Mueller Matrix Polarimetry images
        
        ultrasound: Reconstruction and processing of 3D US images from 2D slices
