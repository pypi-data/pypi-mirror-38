Description: # QForestMath
        
        A small wrapper for basic arithmetic operations using QISkit.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install QForestMath using pip, the python package management tool:
        pip install QForestMath
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Please ensure that you have qiskit installed before you try to run any
        programs using QForestMath, as all functionality involves the use of
        various qiskit modules such as QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, and CompostiteGate.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Functions:
        
        add.add(addend, addend, circ)
        
        subtract.subtract(minuend, subtrahend, circ)
        
        multiply.multiply(multiplicand, multiplier, accumulator, ancillary, 	circ, anc_index)
        
        divide.divide(dividend, divisor, accumulator, ancillary, circ, anc_index)
        
        ## Description
        
        QForestMath abstracts the process of constructing quantum circuits for
        elementary arithmetic operations by substituting them with function calls. 
        
        Every function in the library is meant to be used as a smaller part of a larger quantum circuit, and hence does not return any values, but simply adds an appropriate gate sequence to the QuantumCircuit object's QASM string.
        
        The addition and subtraction functions are implemented using the quantum Fourier transform, and the multiplication and division functions are implemented using repeated addition and subtraction, repsectively. The GCD function uses a combination of these operations to acheive the equivalent result.
