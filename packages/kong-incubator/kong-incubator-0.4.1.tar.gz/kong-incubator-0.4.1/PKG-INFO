Description: # Async Python Client for Kong (exp fork of aio-kong)
        
        Forked from [aio-kong](https://github.com/lendingblock/aio-kong)
        by [Luca Sbardella](https://github.com/lsbardel).
        
        For managing Kong using declarative configuration (`yaml`),
        over manual bookeeping of `curl`s and/or resource state handling `bash` scripts.
        
        Changes to the original:
          - Patch tests to pass with Kong 0.14.x and 1.0.0rc2
          - Added [docker-compose stack](https://github.com/asyrjasalo/kongpose) for tests
          - Added `make` rules for `flake8`, `test`, `build`, `publish_pypi`, etc.
          - Added separate `.venvs`  for dev and release, handled by `make` rules
          - Added (opinionated) `pytest` plugins for dev venv, to help myself
          - Added `KADMIN_` env vars for using via Kong Admin API loopback with key-auth
        
        TODO:
          - PR Kong 0.14.x to original if can make it compatible with 0.13
          - Consider adding an `--option` for creating Kong Admin API loopback service
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        On Python >= 3.6:
        
            pip install --upgrade kong-incubator
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### CLI
        
        Create or update the Kong resources according to configuration:
        
            kong-incubator --yaml config.yaml
        
        By default, target `KONG_URL` is [http://127.0.0.1:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001).
        
        Run `kong-incubator` for the list of options.
        
        ### Python
        
        ```python
        from kong.client import Kong
        
        async with Kong() as cli:
            services = await cli.services.get_list()
            print(json.dumps(services, indent=4))
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        To create the `docker-compose` stack and run tests for it:
        
            make test
        
        Tests clean up the Kong resources they create.
        The docker volume for DB persists until `make testdown` or `make clean` is ran.
        
        Run `make` for the list of rules.
